   **         Fixed: Total Count Reset Bug                        **
   **                                                             **
   **          When the script is executed too many times, at the **
   **          same time, the total.dat file would become corrupt **
   **          and revert to zero.                                **
   **                                                             **
   **          Fix involved padding the total.dat file so its     **
   **          filesize (in bytes) would give the total count.    **
   **                                                             **
   **         Added: Administration Area                          **
   **                                                             **
   **          When the statistics.php page is viewed directly,   **
   **          the owner(s) can login to view the statistics      **
   **          and edit the total count if needed.                **
   **                                                             **
   **          Please be aware that your total count is the same  **
   **          as the filesize of your total.dat file (in bytes). **
   **                                                             **
   **          For example, if your total count was 1048576, your **
   **          total.dat file would be 1 megabyte in size.        **
   **                                                             **
   **   1.1 - 03.01.2006                                          **
   **                                                             **
   **         Fixed: Visitor Count                                **
   **                                                             **
   **          Visitor counts are tracked by IP addresses. IP's   **
   **          visiting Today, that had also visited Yesterday,   **
   **          had their Yesterday record updated to Today. This  **
   **          was correct but their visit for Yesterday was then **
   **          lost and not included in the Yesterday count.      **
   **                                                             **
   **          To rectify this, the system for incrementating     **
   **          counts has been changed so an IP can now have a    **
   **          record for both Today and Yesterday.               **
   **                                                             **
