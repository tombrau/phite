In this case, over 40 years. The unaired alternate pilot for the original Star Trek  has been found, and it is to be released on Blu-ray next month (this should mean that the quality is very good, and it was kept in pristine condition).</p>
<p>The announcement came from <a href="http://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/09/11/14/209253/Alternate-Star-Trek-TOS-Pilot-Found?from=rss&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Slashdot%2Fslashdot+%28Slashdot%29&amp;utm_content=LocalHost">slashdot</a> -</p>
<blockquote><p><em>&#8220;Star Trek fans know there were two pilots for the original series. The first, &#8216;The Cage,&#8217; was rejected by NBC for being &#8216;too cerebral&#8217; (ah, some things never change). The second, &#8216;Where No Man Has Gone Before,&#8217; replaced the actor who played the captain with William Shatner and was more action driven. That pilot had an alternate version which was largely lost and has never aired. Apparently, a film collector in Germany acquired the print and &#8216;recently brought it to the attention&#8217; of CBS/Paramount. CBS is now releasing this version on Blu-ray Dec. 15.&#8221;</em></p></blockquote>
<p>and from <a href="http://www.thrfeed.com/neverbeforeseen-star-trek-pilot-found.html">The Live Feed</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The alternate version is in three parts with 1970s-style act breaks, an entirely different version of Captain James T. Kirk&#8217;s opening monologue (&#8221;But now a new task. A probe out into where no man has gone before&#8221;) and music that contrasts from the famous opening theme and an extended action sequence.</p>
<p>From the release:</p>
<p><em>This version of &#8220;Where No Man Has Gone Before&#8221; was completed in 1965 and features archived footage that was not included in the pilot episode ultimately broadcasted.  Never-before-aired, this newly recovered version is believed to be what was originally screened for NBC, and the basis for their decision to broadcast STAR TREK®. &#8230; </em>&#8220;When we first discovered the original film print existed, we jumped at the chance to give STAR TREK fans the opportunity to add this never aired pilot to their collections,&#8221; said Ken Ross, executive vice president and general manager of CBS Home Entertainment. &#8220;It will be a real treat for fans to see and hear how it all could have begun.&#8221;</p>
<p>The restored pilot will be included in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002PQ7JQA?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=thlife0e-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B002PQ7JQA">&#8220;Star Trek: Original Series - Season 3&#8243; Blu-ray release.</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some people were commenting on the site that not much was changed, and that the scenes were largely the same, but then this stuff is the sort of thing that fans go nuts about, and others don&#8217;t give it a second thought.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s simply a matter of where you stand. For people like me, it&#8217;s something really cool, and I&#8217;ll be wanting to get it, no matter how little it might differ.</p>

<p>So technically, only one of these machines is an upgrade.  There is, however, no difference on the machines.  I just wish I could install the 64 bit version on the Intel machine too.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of bitching about Flash being wonky with 64 bit Ubuntu.  Since I hate Flash, I&#8217;m probably the wrong guy to ask.  I will tell you that it seems to work on imbedded-type messages in online bulletin boards but not going to YouTube, whatever that means.  I haven&#8217;t cared enough to go looking for a solution as yet.  Really looking forward to HTML 5, which, as I understand it, does away with Flash. <em><span>(YAY!)</span></em></p>
<p>The most noticeable changes are the boot/shutdown times.  They&#8217;re quick.  Tiny hardware issues I had with previous versions seemed to disappear.</p>
<p>I would be remiss in my duties if I did not mention the new graphics, as that&#8217;s all anyone seems to be concerned about.  As I stated in my review 48 hours into things, the hideous brown has been replaced by a hideous blue (and blue is my favorite color).  I don&#8217;t care because I don&#8217;t use anything as it appears out of the box.</p>
<p>Whereas my prior review might have (mis)indicated my feelings about 9.10, I want to state unequivocally that I like 9.10.  Just the startup time improvement was good by me.</p>
<p>The systems have all been rock-solid, without exception.  When I ran the live cd on my laptop and homemade desktop before installing, it detected everything.</p>
<p>And once again, moving to 64 bit is the way to go - period.  It&#8217;s better than any hardware upgrade I have ever done.  During updates, the processing at the command line flies by so fast I can no longer read it.  <em><span>When was the last time a Windows update did that for you?</span></em></p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p><strong>YOU DID <em>WHAT</em> WITH YOUR HOME PARTITION?</strong></p>
<p>When going to upgrade my main home box to 64 bit, I realized I had not created a separate HOME partition on the drive.</p>
<p>ALWAYS CREATE A SEPARATE HOME PARTITION WHEN INSTALLING LINUX.  This way you can keep all of your settings and data if you install a different linux (or go from 32 to 64 bits).</p>
<p>Something weird happened at this point: I remembered an article I saved about what to do if you didn&#8217;t create a separate HOME partition.  Of course I couldn&#8217;t remember WHERE I put it and didn&#8217;t want to bother looking.  I cleaned off 10gigs of space and booted to 9.10 live mode.  Gparted was kind enough to allow me to create a 10g partition and keep my existing partition.  I then did an install to the new partition (/) and marked the existing HOME partition to be mounted as such.  <em><span>SUCCESS!</span></em></p>
<p>The machine <strong>flies</strong>.  It should be more interesting when I get around to installing the additional 2g of RAM I have sitting its little box.</p>

<p><a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/yLknPEAB17iLNhajyoliWsmBszY/0/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/yLknPEAB17iLNhajyoliWsmBszY/0/di" border="0" ismap="true"></img></a><br/>
<a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/yLknPEAB17iLNhajyoliWsmBszY/1/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/yLknPEAB17iLNhajyoliWsmBszY/1/di" border="0" ismap="true"></img></a></p><p>Earlier today, I saw a small piece on <a href="http://www.maximumpc.com/article/news/windows_7_oem_eula_excludes_home_builds_not_resale">Maximum PC</a> about the OEM System Builder copies of Windows being technically illegal for home users, and also, strangely enough, system builders, to use on a PC that will be used by them.</p>
<blockquote><p>Whenever we recommend a build list for new systems, we inevitably turn to Windows OEM editions for the OS. They are bit for bit just as powerful as their retail cousins, but may require a bit of telephone tag with Microsoft when upgrading and you were stuck with nobody to call if you need support. Overall the experience wasn&#8217;t so bad given the discount, but an important, albeit subtle change in the Windows 7 EULA could <a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/win7/oem.asp">permanently alter this recommendation</a>. The specific clause found in prior OEM editions of Windows is as follows:</p>
<p>&#8220;OEM system builder software packs are intended for PC and server manufacturers or assemblers ONLY. They are not intended for distribution to end users. Unless the end user is actually assembling his/her own PC, in which case, that end user is considered a system builder as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>As you can see from the above passage, prior versions clearly made allowance for those that assembled their own system, sadly, <a href="http://oem.microsoft.com/public/sblicense/2008_sb_licenses/fy08_sb_license_english.pdf">this is no longer the case in Windows 7</a>. Assuming this isn&#8217;t a mistake (and when do lawyers ever make mistakes), then Windows 7 OEM editions can legally only be installed on machines you intend to sell. I suppose you could always pawn off your new machine to a family member for a song, then politely ask them to return it, but Microsoft clearly wants to push more home users over to the retail edition.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the past, this has been acknowledged as a legitimate usage of the OEM version, and the major problem was always identified as being that when the motherboard dies,  effectively so does the copy of Windows. Of course, you could possibly find another identical motherboard, so that the copy installed will not complain, but otherwise, the copy of Windows is truly dead. (This is in legal terms – I&#8217;m not sure if you could actually get by with moving a copy from one make of motherboard to the next – but know this, it would be technically illegal.)</p>
<p>Perhaps ZDNet&#8217;s Ed Bott saw the story on the Maximum PC site as well, because a while later I found a piece in <a href="http://talkback.zdnet.com/5208-12354-0.html?forumID=1&amp;threadID=71635&amp;messageID=1383000">his regular space</a>, describing the controversy, the lack of respect for the customer, and the ability of Microsoft to muck up what should be  simple instructions to convey their corporate wishes.</p>
<blockquote><p>I’m talking about OEM System Builder licenses for Windows desktop editions. If you look at any online shopping site that caters to PC enthusiasts, you’ll find these copies displayed alongside the upgrade and full license packages that Microsoft says retail customers are supposed to buy. My friend and fellow Windows expert Paul Thurrott just posted a <a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/win7/oem.asp">thorough look at the Windows 7 OEM System Builder package</a>, complete with pictures. If you’re building your own PC or looking for installation media that won’t make you jump through hoops to install it, this product is extremely attractive, because it’s significantly less expensive than a full retail license. The installation media works almost exactly like a full retail copy of Windows, except that it can’t be used for upgrades.</p>
<p>Many readers tell me they bought that software and installed it on their own new (or old) PC, happily saving a significant chunk of change in the process. According to Microsoft, they are violating the terms of the OEM System Builder license agreement, which says, in convoluted language, that you must install the software using the OEM Preinstallation Kit and then resell the PC to a third party. If you install that software on your own PC, you don’t have a “genuine” copy of Windows.</p>
<p>But how are you supposed to know? Microsoft allows any online retailer to sell OEM System Builder software with no indication of its terms and conditions. A consumer is expected to read the license agreement printed in tiny type on the outside of the OEM System Builder software package and then translate its dense legalese into plain English (<a href="http://oem.microsoft.com/script/contentpage.aspx?PageID=552857">PDF here</a>):</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Bott continues by showing where those who are supposed to be in the know don&#8217;t seem to. He gives illustrations of the way things used to be handled, the places where information covering this were once displayed, and notes that these places of displayed information have been suspiciously sanitized (obviously for Microsoft&#8217;s protection).</p>
<p>He then comes up with an admission that normally he is arrow-straight about licensing, but in this case he gives his approval until Microsoft comes clean and clears this one up.</p>
<p>Just when I was giving up on him totally, <em>Ed restores my faith in part of the press, and shows he has a pair</em>.</p>
<p><strong>I applaud his sense of right and wrong</strong>, and hope it doesn&#8217;t cost him anything (really). This is another place where Microsoft, shown in the past two weeks to be turning, in some ways, from the dark side, could help its cause again, with a simple press release and apology for being obtuse once again.</p>

No, it&#8217;s not the specter of Al Qaeda in the Middle East, waiting to attack, it is the activation scheme for Microsoft Windows. The activation scheme is something that makes Microsoft happy, as they mistakenly believe that they are keeping piracy down, and annoys many of us who are bothered by the false positives and pains we have to take when using their products.</p>
<p>A story that has been reported in about three places now, <em>which is usually my number before I act on anything controversial like this</em>, in <a href="http://www.maximumpc.com/article/news/windows_7_activation_bypassed_yes_again_keyless_activation">Maximum PC</a> tells about the latest strike on Microsoft.</p>
<blockquote><p>It has long been said that software activation merely inconveniences and punishes honest customers, while pirates rarely have to deal with the same restrictions. It was true in the past, and it has been proven true again today with new reports from the pirate community claiming that the Windows 7 online activation has been successfully bypassed (<a href="http://www.maximumpc.com/article/news/windows_7_rtm_cracked_already">yet again</a>). Not only do those using the new crack not have to activate, but they <a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/11/06/removewat-or-chew-wga-bypass-activate-windows-7-and-server-2008-r2-forever-loader-alternative-to-remove-disable-activation-technologies/">don&#8217;t even need a CD key at all</a>. The crack apparently nullifies sppcompai.dll, and even takes care of those pesky popup reminders that would normally keep nagging you to activate.</p>
<p>The most unfortunate part of this story however, is the fact that the crack seems to take advantage of the leniency of the activation mechanism which was tweaked in Windows 7 to try and reduce false-positives or accidental activation errors. We can only hope that Microsoft&#8217;s response to this hack will be even handed, and not encourage them to tighten up the activation process so much so that it makes it harder on legitimate purchasers or upgraders.</p></blockquote>
<p>That last sentence sums it up for me, because the annoyance of the false positive is the one thing that, when it happens, is what pushes me toward another operating system for the bulk of my computer use.</p>
<p>In Microsoft&#8217;s favor, it&#8217;s not about outrageous fees anymore, because the number of ways to legitimately receive a copy of Windows, for a reasonable amount, has been increased tremendously. While I&#8217;m sure that for some, it is simply an exercise in the possibility of cracking the restrictions, for others it is a way to show a sort of superiority that makes many suffer.</p>
<p>I would like to see the actual numbers of piracy in the U.S., because, from everything I read, and have seen, <strong>the overwhelming majority of people get their PC from an OEM </strong>(which means Microsoft is getting their money for the license), and self-built PCs are a very small minority of machines extant. Therefore, I wonder how much actual piracy is being stopped here; perhaps prompting Microsoft to release U.S. only versions without the annoyances of the WGA and other implementations.</p>
<p>While I know that someone from Microsoft might state that a much bigger problem is the case of smaller OEMs, the so-called &#8220;white box&#8221; vendors, using the same keys for many machines, I don&#8217;t think it is that rampant. This was something I have seen, but as with the other things in our society where the individual is inconvenienced greatly, simply because it is easier for the party that is enforcing something to pursue that path, <strong>the end-user&#8217;s needs should always be held above those of the large entity</strong>, whether it is corporate (Microsoft) or governmental (NY attorney general&#8217;s office). <strong> It is up to the larger entity to pursue that path that inconveniences the fewest number of people, not the most.</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;m certain that this path would yield <strong>much better results</strong> for Microsoft, both monetarily and in the consciousness of the users of its products.</p>

The iPhone and iPod Touch have received a lot of accolades for their revolutionary user interface. Some users buy their phones based largely on the user interface. Whether your computer runs Windows, Linux or Macintosh, most of your interaction with your computer is through the graphic user interface (desktop).</p>
<p>When an operating system is upgraded, the most noticed features involve the GUI. Apple is famous for their GUI. Microsoft has for years been playing catch-up with Apple over the user interface. Linux users are flocking to Ubuntu, primarily due to its friendly and functional user interface. We have recently seen new releases of Mac’s OS X, Windows 7 and Ubuntu 9.10, all of which focused on a better experience for the user by improvements to the GUI.</p>
<p>At the same time many of us “geeks” continue to complain about the number of “clueless users”, computer owners who don’t understand much about their computer beyond the user interface. It’s a situation akin to the car owner who knows how to drive the car but has no idea what goes on under the hood, no clue as to how to add oil or change the filters. People who mistake the desktop for their computer or AOL for the internet are the stock of many in-jokes in the IT world. Many of us who have worked help desks shake our heads at the stories we’ve heard. We think it’s a shame that more people aren’t interested in the inner workings of their computers or that more don’t take an interest in the amazing things a user can accomplish from the command line.</p>
<p>I suspect that in the interest of making computers “user friendly” we’ve created a situation in which people don’t have to learn much about their own computers. GUIs are so easy to navigate there’s hardly a need to delve further into commands, scripts and other advanced functions.</p>
<p>Even when the effort is made to get users to think more about their computer’s functioning it’s often unappreciated. With Windows Vista Microsoft introduced the User Account Control (UAC), an effort to alert users when a program or website attempted to make changes to their system. The unintended result was that either users disabled UAC altogether or became jaded and clicked “approve” without reading the content of the warning. This attempt to create more aware users failed, so much so that in Windows 7 Microsoft grants us the ability to restrict the UAC notices that pop up.</p>
<p>Many computer users want to be just that, users. They have no interest in knowing why things happen on their computers, they just want them to work the way they need them to work. The inability of legacy apps to run on newer systems, their inability to make their 1999 printer work with their 2009 operating system simply frustrates them as there’s no “fix this problem” icon on the desktop. It’s doubly frustrating to those of us who try to help them by explaining why the system is failing them. They don’t want to know, they just want it to work.</p>
<p>Maybe if GUIs were a bit less intuitive, maybe if computer interfaces required their user to understand a bit more about why problems occur and what can be done to remedy them  we’d have fewer “clueless users”.</p>
<p>Of course there would also be less need for us geeks.</p>

There is basic decency in some in 2009. A story on the <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8361457.stm">BBC website</a> shows it is alive and well in the U.S., which must have been enough of a surprise for it to be reported there.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>A former student at an Arizona school has returned two library books, 50 years late, and with a $1,000 (£600) cheque to cover overdue fees.</strong></p>
<p>Librarian Georgette Bordine at Camelback High School in Phoenix said the books were checked out in 1959.</p>
<p>The person, who wanted to remain anonymous, calculated the fee as 4c a day, with some extra in case the rates had changed, media reports said.</p>
<p>Apparently the books were inadvertently packed when the student moved state.</p>
<p>Ms Bordine said the money would be used to buy more books, with the overdue ones - about conservation - returned to the shelves.</p></blockquote>
<p>While I&#8217;m not sure that the average of four cents a day still covers it, I&#8217;m sure that this was a tale spread far and wide in that school district as an object lesson.</p>
<p>What might be most interesting to see –<em> if the books were ever replaced during their absence, and does the librarian use their condition as an object lesson for the better care of library books while in the hands of students</em>.</p>

Moms are finding that staying at home and blogging can be lucrative as food companies are starting to offer free trips, products and more. But with the FTC trying to impose guidelines for bloggers and free products they receive, is there a real conflict of interest?</p>
<p>The FTC has stated that bloggers must disclose financial incentives or product compensation if given to a blogger in exchange for a review. What is not clear is how these guidelines will be imposed. Some are saying that the FTC has guidelines that are unclear and that this causes confusion in the bloging community.</p>
<p>A recent article at the Los Angeles Times states the following:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>But recently, these bloggers say, food companies have upped the ante, bombarding them with free trips to corporate kitchens and mountains of edible swag.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Starbucks, eager to get working parents drinking its Via instant coffee, sent limousines to shuttle bloggers in New York City for a private lunch with executives. They left with bags stuffed with coffee and offers of bottomless future refills.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Fast-food purveyor Taco Bell flew a group of bloggers from Maryland, Michigan and Missouri to California for a retreat this spring, paid for their lodging and let them spend the day creating new taco and burrito concoctions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kraft Foods curried favor with mommy bloggers by bringing some to Los Angeles for the Grilled Cheese Invitational, in an effort to get online parents hungry for cheese.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s a strategy that recalls post-World War II ad campaigns, in which women touted the benefits of certain laundry soaps and the household brands that would make them a domestic goddess.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&#8220;They handle the family budget,&#8221; said Amanda Vega, an industry consultant who specializes in social media and public relations. &#8220;People read them and believe them, because they&#8217;re easy to identify with.&#8221;</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>I can understand that consumers would believe a mommy blogger outside of the corporate environment than they would a star that has been paid to promote a product. But should the moms have to disclose who is giving them products? Would these promotions influence the reviews these Moms may provide?</p>
<p>Let me know what you think.</p>

But now the FTC is filing new charges against BlueHippo, which includes the fact that some 35,000 consumers have been duped by BlueHippo into believing the company was a legitimate business. The charges, which can be read in a court filing by the FTC, linked below, makes some  starling revelations about how BlueHippo functions.</p>
<p>In the court document it states that:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Declaring “BlueHippo to the Rescue,” defendants BlueHippo Funding, LLC, BlueHippo Capital, LLC (collectively, “BlueHippo”) and their owner Joseph K. Rensin (together with BlueHippo, “Contempt Defendants”) aggressively market BlueHippo as a company in the business of financing computers to credit-challenged consumers. In reality, BlueHippo is in no such business. In fact, in the year following entry of this Court’s Stipulated Final Judgment and</strong></p>
<p><strong>Order for a Permanent Injunction (“Order”), BlueHippo financed – at most – a single computer to the over 35,000 consumers who had contracted with BlueHippo in time to receive computers by year’s end. Ironically, while BlueHippo failed to finance computers for these duped consumers – those same consumers financed BlueHippo with more than $15 million in payments. Contempt Defendants’ not only lie about the nature of BlueHippo’s business, but also about when and whether consumers would receive merchandise once consumers meet all of their onerous conditions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Moreover, adding insult to injury, consumers desperate to get out of Contempt Defendants’ money pit find that Blue Hippo’s “store credit” refund policy contains onerous conditions that were not disclosed when they placed their orders. Contempt Defendant’s failure to disclose these conditions to any of the company’s more than 61,000 post-Order customers, who in total paid BlueHippo more than $21 million, also violates the Order.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>If these allegations are true, one would hope that the FTC would be able to seize all of the assets of the company and pay back the money to the victims of this scam.</p>
<p>Have you ordered a computer from BlueHippo? If so what has your experience been? Are these allegations true?</p>
<p>Comments welcome.</p>

This is totally independent of the current Chrome browser, in case you&#8217;re wondering.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what is being claimed in a blog post by someone on the Google campus.</p>
<p>A story in <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9140821/Google_aims_for_faster_Web_downloads_with_SPDY_protocol?source=rss_news">ComputerWorld</a> gives the changes that would be needed -</p>
<blockquote><p>Google is hoping to make Web pages download up to twice as quickly using SPDY, a new application-layer protocol it&#8217;s experimenting with, the company said in a <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2009/11/2x-faster-web.html">blog post</a>.</p>
<p>It wants to improve on the performance of using HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) by minimizing latency. For the protocol to work, the browser and the web server have to be upgraded, but changes to Web pages are not needed, according to Google.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s lab tests of <a href="http://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/spdy/spdy-whitepaper">SPDY</a> show an improvement in page load times compared to HTTP of between 27% and 60%, and between 39% and 55% when using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), it said.</p>
<p>The company still needs to do a lot of work to evaluate the performance of SPDY in real-world conditions, the blog post said.</p></blockquote>
<p>The next part of the story talks about prioritizing requests, sending packets simultaneously, and a compression scheme, which immediately makes me wonder if we are not talking about a modified (<em>or perhaps only modified enough to escape patent problems</em>) <strong>Opera Turbo</strong> scheme.</p>
<blockquote><p>Google conducted the tests by downloading 25 of the &#8220;top 100&#8243; web sites ten times each over simulated home network connections, using a prototype Google Chrome browser and a Web server that it has developed.</p>
<p>SPDY uses a number of techniques to speed Web downloads, including allowing many concurrent HTTP requests across a single TCP session, prioritizing the requests, and using compression to reduce the number of packets and overall amount of data sent.</p>
<p>Google doesn&#8217;t want to start from scratch with SPDY. The protocol still uses HTTP headers, but it overrides other parts of the protocol, such as connection management and data transfer formats.</p>
<p>&#8220;That Google is trying to improve download speeds is great, and the numbers are very promising,&#8221; said Måns Jonasson, a web developer at IIS, which is responsible for the top-level Swedish Internet domain, .se.</p>
<p>For something like SPDY to work everyone has to be on board. The protocol won&#8217;t become a success unless it&#8217;s supported in both Internet Explorer and Firefox, according to Jonasson. It might be able to convince Mozilla to implement the protocol in Firefox, but convincing Microsoft will be difficult, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Microsoft seems to hate everything Google does,&#8221; said Jonasson.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://dev.chromium.org/spdy">source code for the prototype Google Chrome browser</a> is available for download. The code for the server will be released as open source in the near future, it said.</p></blockquote>
<p>We have seen Microsoft embrace open source lately (<em>not that it has not always, as the very first Microsoft TCP/IP stack was &#8216;derived&#8217; from the then current BSD stack</em>), so perhaps that would not be such a problem. On the other hand, so what if Microsoft doesn&#8217;t adopt the changes? As its share of the browser landscape is shrinking all the time, it might be aware enough at this point to know that it must be less intransigent, in order to survive.</p>
<blockquote><p>That Google is opening up the code is good, but it also needs to approach standards organization IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force), Jonasson said.</p>
<p>Development efforts on other protocols to speed Web downloads, such as SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) and SST (Structured Stream Transport), have seen little activity in recent years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps it is time to take up the cause, and work on these abandoned projects, as they might yield better results, or perhaps be folded together, as something that provides a synergy for the final product.</p>
<p>When things like this occur, we are all reminded of the times when CPU manufacturers have run up against speed limits by merely raising clock speeds. When that happens, the engineers start looking for economy of overhead, and the ability to increase the number of instructions executed per clock cycle, along with larger amounts of data processed concurrently. By implementing this sort of aggregated method, perhaps we can see some very real gains in speed of current connections.</p>
<p>No one will be upset about that.</p>

<blockquote><p>Microsoft late on Friday confirmed that an unpatched vulnerability exists in Windows 7, but downplayed the problem, saying most users would be protected from attack by blocking two ports at the firewall.</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/advisory/977544.mspx">security advisory</a>, Microsoft acknowledged that a bug in SMB (Server Message Block), a Microsoft-made network file- and print-sharing protocol, could be used by attackers to cripple Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 machines.</p>
<p>The zero-day vulnerability was <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9140704/Unpatched_SMB_bug_crashes_Windows_7_researcher_says">first reported by Canadian researcher Laurent Gaffie</a> last Wednesday, when he revealed the bug and posted proof-of-concept attack code to the Full Disclosure security mailing list and his blog. According to Gaffie, exploiting the flaw crashes Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 systems so thoroughly that the only recourse is to manually power off the computers.</p>
<p>At the time, Microsoft only said it was investigating Gaffie&#8217;s reports.</p></blockquote>
<p>The story in Computerworld continues by telling that Friday, Microsoft admitted the flaw and published an advisory concerning the problem. while explaining that the problem, while a nuisance, could not do any harm other than causing results similar to denial of service, because there is no way to insert malicious code.</p>
<p>Some bad news in this is the fact that Microsoft doesn&#8217;t seem especially energized to put out a fix for this at top speed, presumably because of the limited problems that could be caused, but perhaps because of difficulty in pulling off the exploit. Still, it might be a good idea to protect those possible sales of Windows Server 2008R2 that haven&#8217;t been rung up on the register.</p>
<blockquote><p>Then on Friday, it took the next step and issued the advisory. &#8220;Microsoft is aware of public, detailed exploit code that would cause a system to stop functioning or become unreliable,&#8221; Dave Forstrom, a spokesman for Microsoft security group, said in an e-mail. &#8220;The company is not aware of attacks to exploit the reported vulnerability at this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Forstrom echoed Gaffie&#8217;s comments earlier in the week that while an exploit could incapacitate a PC, the vulnerability could not be used by hackers to install malicious code on a Windows 7 system.</p>
<p>Both SMBv1 and its successor, SMBv2, contain the bug. &#8220;Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 and Windows 2000 are not affected,&#8221; assured Forstrom.</p>
<p>Attacks could be aimed at any browser, not just Internet Explorer (IE), Microsoft warned. After tricking users into visiting a malicious site or a previously-compromised domain, hackers could feed them specially-crafted URIs (uniform resource identifier), and then crash their PCs with malformed SMB packets.</p>
<p>Microsoft said it may patch the problem, but didn&#8217;t spell out a timetable or commit to an out-of-cycle update before the next regularly-scheduled Patch Tuesday of Dec. 8. Instead, the company suggested users block TCP ports 139 and 445 at the firewall. Doing so, however, would disable browsers as well as a host of critical services, including network file-sharing and IT group policies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not exactly what you might call a good solution. This appears to be similar to fixing the <strong>old Ford Pinto&#8217;s predilection for blowing up when hit from behind</strong> by telling the driver to <strong>simply stop putting gasoline in the tank</strong>. No gas, no possible explosion!</p>
<p>and then -</p>
<blockquote><p>Gaffie&#8217;s vulnerability was the first zero-day reported and confirmed by Microsoft in Windows 7 since the new operating system went on sale Oct. 22.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, but there will be more vulnerabilities,<strong> there always are</strong>.</p>

		<description>Believe it or not, we&amp;#8217;re just getting started when it comes to the Christmas shopping season.

<p><a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/YkfEh-k6jCGv5Ds_MGOixYGp4A8/0/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/YkfEh-k6jCGv5Ds_MGOixYGp4A8/0/di" border="0" ismap="true"></img></a><br/>
<a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/YkfEh-k6jCGv5Ds_MGOixYGp4A8/1/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/YkfEh-k6jCGv5Ds_MGOixYGp4A8/1/di" border="0" ismap="true"></img></a></p><p>Believe it or not, we&#8217;re just getting started when it comes to the Christmas shopping season. This is a huge event for the shopping industry, but it&#8217;s also a time where the costumer can get some pretty wicked discounts. Today I&#8217;d like to bring up the discussion of what you think is the hottest gadget this year. There have been a wide variety of new releases in a wide variety of categories including cellphones, HD Pocket Cameras, GPS, and much more. Which gadget do you think is going to be the most popular for Christmas?</p>
<p>In my mind, one of the best devices this year is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HOPUPC?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bradwelltvcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002HOPUPC">Kodak Zi8</a>, which I&#8217;m hoping will be in my stocking for Christmas. This nifty little camcorder is one of the more advanced pocket cams on the market right now. Allowing for up to 1080p recording and the ability to plug in an external microphone, there&#8217;s no doubt in my mind that this camera will be a hot seller during the upcoming shopping season.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other interesting new products that came out this year. The Motorola Droid, the Palm Pre, and of course, the iPhone have been real competitors when it comes to smart phones. Although the iPhone is without a doubt the most popular of the three, it has been proven with these new releases that there is still some fight left in these companies.</p>
<p>There will be plenty of <a href="http://bradwelltv.com/bradley/category/deals-savings/">deals and savings</a> throughout the upcoming weeks. Since companies are fighting for every last dollar they can get, you&#8217;ll probably notice a sharp decrease on some of the most popular items. Definitely keep an eye out on <a href="http://tagjag.com">Tagjag</a> and <a href="http://coupons.lockergnome.com">Coupons.lockergnome.com</a>.</p>
<p>With that said, what gadgets do you think will be the first off the shelves?</p>

If anyone were to view the news reels from this era in the future, I strongly feel they would think we&#8217;re just a large bunch of angry, murderous thugs who were out to destroy the world and play with dogs from the SPCA once a week. Most news networks claim to carry the &#8220;news you want.&#8221; Where is our want in this? Do we want to hear of a famous pop star&#8217;s death for weeks on end? Do we want live coverage of Paris Hilton ordering a film crew to have live lobsters for her on demand?</p>
<p>Did the news share with you the story of sixteen younger men from the University of Texas at Arlington who gathered together and spent the night under the stars, two hours south of their scholastic home building brotherhood and friendship? Did the news share with you the story of the sixteen young men who spent several intense rounds playing paintball, returning to their scholastic home bruised, filthy and exhausted? Did the news share with you the story of these sixteen young men who after twenty-four hours of building brotherhood, friendship and maturity, descended upon a nursing home to spread the universal language of music?</p>
<p>Would you rather hear about people being murdered in the streets?</p>
<p>Would you rather hear another story about healthcare?</p>
<p>Would you rather feel what those sixteen young men felt singing for the elderly and realizing that they may have been the only visitor for a patient who might not have any living relatives? Would you rather hear of these men walking from room to room, singing to the elderly who could not eat in the dining room? Would you rather hear the joy and sense of fulfillment that burst forth from their hearts like the fiery plume of a launching rocket as they gathered into a large circle, put their arms on eachothers&#8217; sore, bruised shoulders and sang their parting song before departing back to their homes?</p>
<p>Would you rather hear about the death of a porn star?</p>
<p>Where has all the good news gone? Does it still exist even if the news media decline to share it with those who choose to indulge in the information distribution that such corporations facilitate?</p>
<p>You decide.</p>
<p><em>Comments are welcome, but please for this article, you may say whether or not you would want to hear more stories based upon healthcare, but this is not the place to debate universal healthcare. I have another article dealing with that issue.</em></p>
<p><em>More information: The sixteen young men I was referring to are members of the Sigma Omega Colony of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia and they partook in their Brotherhood Retreat and the Mills Music Mission. I am one of the sixteen and this weekend has been life-changing. I was almost to the verge of tears before the end of our visit. It was a very humbling experience.</em></p>

<p><a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/ZrbRxl0Mdiz_XWOhsr2NIf0ALFk/0/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/ZrbRxl0Mdiz_XWOhsr2NIf0ALFk/0/di" border="0" ismap="true"></img></a><br/>
<a href="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/ZrbRxl0Mdiz_XWOhsr2NIf0ALFk/1/da"><img src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~a/ZrbRxl0Mdiz_XWOhsr2NIf0ALFk/1/di" border="0" ismap="true"></img></a></p><p>An article on <a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20091114101637997">Groklaw</a> today, gives the news that Psystar, the company that believed it could take on the lawyers of Cupertino, where others had failed, has been left with no legal standing for any of its ventures, whatsoever.</p>
<blockquote><p>Psystar just got what&#8217;s coming to them in the California case. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.groklaw.net/pdf2/Psystar-214.pdf">the order</a> [PDF]. It&#8217;s a total massacre. Psystar&#8217;s first-sale defense went down in flames. Apple&#8217;s motion for summary judgment on copyright infringement and DMCA violation is granted. Apple prevailed also on its motion to seal.</p>
<p>Psystar&#8217;s motion for summary judgment on trademark infringement and trade dress is denied. So is its illusory motion for copyright misuse.</p>
<p>There are still issues remaining for trial, despite Psystar&#8217;s attempt to present everything now as being moot. Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s left to be decided at trial: Apple&#8217;s allegations of breach of contract; induced breach of contract, trademark infringement; trademark dilution; trade dress infringement; and state unfair competition under California Business and Professions Code § 17200; and common law unfair competition. See anything on that list that will be helpful to Psystar?</p>
<p>So that means damages ahead for Psystar on the copyright issues just decided on summary judgment, at a minimum. The court asked for briefs on that subject. In short, Psystar is toast. Psystar&#8217;s only hope now is Florida, and frankly I wouldn&#8217;t bet the house on that one. Judges notice if you were just found guilty of a similar cause of action in another state.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re surprised? I told you, I told you, I told you. So, to those who feel crushed at the moment, there could be an appeal, I suppose. And if you want freedom for your code, you certainly can find it on Planet Earth. Look in <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/en/get-fedora">the right direction</a>. You&#8217;ll be happy you did, because you can hack away to your heart&#8217;s content, and it&#8217;s perfectly legal. The court&#8217;s message is clear: EULAs mean what they say; if you don&#8217;t want to abide by its license, leave Apple&#8217;s stuff alone.</p>
<p>We have the order for you as text.</p></blockquote>
<p>So it looks as though the only way to have a Hackintosh is, once again, by being a lawbreaker. The little apple must be on the case of the computer that runs OS X, and that appears final.</p>
<p>I wonder how many computers Psystar delivered, and what will happen to those customers. Will they be out in the cold after the next revision? Will they be offered a genuine Mac, at a small discount after surrendering their Psystar machine?</p>
<p>If enough people really wanted to do something about this, they could work with, or otherwise support, the<strong> now dormant Darwin project</strong>. Or perhaps some enterprising people will design an OS X face for FreeBSD, which, in my opinion, would be better (as long as you&#8217;re not going to buy Apple hardware). FreeBSD works great, and has great numbers of components that are supported with drivers.</p>
<p>As the Groklaw story said : <strong>What? You&#8217;re surprised?</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps they should have named it<strong> Pseudostar</strong>.</p>

I was also impressed with the smooth working behavior.</p>
<p>To be honest, I must not stress the program much, because I have only noticed an occasional bug where I have to stop and reboot to get things back to normal. A bit annoying, but nothing spectacular.</p>
<p>Now, with build 16 we have a slew of changes, and hopefully all the bugs have been quashed -</p>
<blockquote><p>Cerulean Studios have just delivered a new beta build of the 4.1 update for their all-in-one IM application known as Trillian Astra. This latest release, <a href="http://www.trillian.im/download/">available here</a>, is all about bug fixing, and it resolves the problems listed below.</p>

<p>- [Skype] Skype plugin does not honor &#8216;Message Windows-&gt;When a new message window is created&#8217; setting</p>
<p>- [Skype] Conference pops up, yet no one is talking</p>

<p>- [Skype] Unable to answer skype call from notification.</p>

<p>- [Skype] Whenever I close Trillian or disconnect from the Skype connection manually via Trillian, it auto-exits any group conversation I&#8217;m in.</p>
<p>- [Twitter] &#8216;Set current tweet&#8217; add %9</p>

<p>- [Twitter] Trillian doesn&#8217;t clear deleted tweets from feed and doesn&#8217;t show new users feeds.</p>
<p>- [Yahoo] When I invite to Y! conference he sees everything in double</p>
<p>- [Away Messages] If POP3 or IMAP are loaded the drop down may not be the correct menu in away message editor</p>
<p>- [Contact List] Issue where the text may not vertically center when it should</p>
<p>- [Contact List] The recent timer stops working</p>
<p>- [Events] Automatically saved messages list truncated to 30 entries</p>
<p>- [Identities] Fresh install of Trillian not saving identities asset</p>
<p>- [Languages] &#8216;Trillian in your language&#8217; rarely refreshes (for some locales?)</p>
<p>- [Message Windows] Link to Trillian.im instead of&nbsp;<a href="http://ceruleanstudios.com" title="http://ceruleanstudios. " >ceruleanstudios.com</a> in promote text</p>

<p>The above from <a href="http://www.tcmagazine.com/comments.php?id=30889&amp;catid=3">Tech Connect</a>.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t use Skype, so I won&#8217;t be able to verify those fixes, but I&#8217;ll report back on results in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Look back here for an UPDATE  addendum.</p>

In another of his attacks, Murdoch continues to threaten Google and continues to pound on his chest stating he will remove his news content from Google search. But it appears Murdock may have bitten off more than he can chew. In a recent news article there is this:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>During a conference call to discuss News Corp first quarter financial results,    the media magnate said he couldn’t promise to meet his own deadline – but    did say it remained a work in progress and “we are all working very hard” on    delivering the pay solution.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Google on the other hand doesn&#8217;t seem to think there are any issues about removing any and all News Corp&#8217;s businesses from their search engine:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>A spokesman for the search giant said: “Google News and web search are a    tremendous source of promotion for news organisations, sending them about    100,000 clicks every minute.</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Publishers put their content on the web because they want it to be found, so    very few choose not to include their material in Google News and web search.    But if they tell us not to include it, we don&#8217;t.”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Removing their content from Google search seems to be rather simple. Yet during the past few months Murdock has been running around the world making idle threats. Heh dude. Do it already and move on.</p>
<p>Comments welcome.</p>

<p><span><span class="Box_56904029_Location">VATICAN CITY (AP/ 1010 WINS) </span> &#8212; Vatican officials and Catholic bishops are getting a lesson on the Internet from Facebook, Wikipedia and Google executives as the church struggles to get its message out in the digital age.</span></p>
<p>A four-day symposium in the Vatican which opened Thursday also will address Internet copyright issues and hacking &#8211; including testimony from a young Swiss hacker and an Interpol cyber-crime official.</p>
<p>The meeting is being hosted by the European bishop&#8217;s media commission and is designed to delve into questions about what Internet culture means for the church&#8217;s mission and how the church communicates that mission to others.</p>
<p>Pope Benedict XVI has tried to bring the Vatican into the Internet age and launched a YouTube channel earlier this year. Officials say he also e-mails and surfs the Web.</p>
<p>But the Vatican&#8217;s online shortcomings have been woefully apparent.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Benedict made clear he was disappointed that Vatican officials hadn&#8217;t done a simple Internet search to discover the Holocaust-denying comments of an ultraconservative bishop before the pontiff lifted his excommunication.</p>
<p>The outrage over the rehabilitation of Bishop Richard Williamson, of the traditionalist Society of St. Pius X, prompted Benedict to write a letter to his bishops admitting mistakes and saying that he had &#8220;learned the lesson&#8221; and that the Vatican would in the future pay greater attention to the Internet as a source of news.</p>
<p>French Bishop Jean-Michel di Falco Leandri, president of the European Episcopal Conference&#8217;s media committee, cited the Williamson affair in his remarks to the opening session, saying it exposed the institutional church&#8217;s communications problems.</p>
<p>He also cited the outcry over the pope&#8217;s own controversial comments that condoms are not the answer to Africa&#8217;s AIDS epidemic and could make it worse. He said the Catholic Church must learn how to communicate in a more effective, instantaneous way &#8211; recognizing how its pronouncements are taken in different cultures &#8211; if it wants to engage the faithful to spread its mission.</p>
<p>&#8220;You either know how to communicate or you don&#8217;t; you are either credible or not,&#8221; he said, according to his prepared remarks. &#8220;You are either alive, or a fossil; you either know the language of the Internet or you don&#8217;t, in which case you can&#8217;t communicate.&#8221;</p>
<p>The stakes are high, he said, noting that Evangelical Web sites in France attract far more users than Catholic ones, even though there are far fewer Evangelicals than Catholics in the country.</p>
<p>The reason? Unlike Catholic sites, which are merely extensions of parish bulletins, Evangelical sites &#8220;seek to reach Internet surfers, using the Internet as a tool and a vehicle for evangelization,&#8221; he said, tapping into a widespread concern at the Vatican about the competition for souls that Evangelical churches represent.</p>
<p>During the symposium, panels will discuss social networks, the Web generation, the church&#8217;s communication strategies, and whether the Internet is changing religious practices.</p>
<p>In many ways, the Internet is just the latest means that the Vatican has used to spread its message, starting with parchment, printing press, radio and television.</p>
<p>Pope John Paul II used mass media and information technology to get out his message, overseeing the 1995 launch of the Vatican&#8217;s Web site, <a href="http://www.vatican.va/">www.vatican.va</a>, which today includes virtual tours of the Vatican Museums and audio feeds from Vatican Radio.</p>

(<em>They have been available since October 22, perhaps earlier</em>)</p>
<p>Although I see nothing wrong with this (it is a separate download, not a push, after all) the guys at <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/182186/windows_7_ads_microsoft_tarts_up_the_desktop.html?tk=rss_news">PC World</a> see this as Microsoft selling out, and a very different path than the one where it copies look and feel of Mac OS X.</p>
<p>Well, first, I don&#8217;t think anyone, outside of the one loose-lipped, delusional employee of Microsoft, ever thought that Windows 7 was more than a thinly veiled thin attempt at emulating OS X. By that I mean they want the overall panache of OS X, but anyone who can see knows it&#8217;s in no way a close approximation.</p>
<p>Microsoft succeeded in making the nicest looking Windows ever, why can&#8217;t the press simply leave it at that?</p>
<blockquote><p>If this is part of Redmond&#8217;s alleged scheme to <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/182014/microsoft_stole_mac_os_aesthetics_so_what.html?tk=rel_news">steal the Mac&#8217;s look</a>, it&#8217;s got the wrong idea.</p>
<p>Microsoft has announced plans to peddle Windows 7 desktop space to advertisers, who&#8217;ll create Windows UI themes&#8211;customized backgrounds, audio clips, and other elements&#8211;that highlight their brand, Computerworld <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9140810/Microsoft_sells_Windows_7_desktop_to_advertisers">reports</a>. In fact, some advertiser themes are already available in the Windows 7 <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/personalize">Personalization Gallery</a>, including desktop pitches for soft drinks (Coca-Cola, Pepsi), autos (Ducati, Ferrari, Infiniti), and big-budget Hollywood blockbusters (<em>Avatar</em>).</p>
<p>Ad-themed desktops are new for Microsoft, which has long allowed PC manufacturers to customize the desktop. Hardware vendors like Acer, Dell, HP, and Sony often muck up the Windows UI with background logos and countless icons for trial apps and other crapware. (Those trial apps provide an additional revenue stream, an ugly necessity in the low-margin world of Windows PCs.) Too often the hardware guys&#8217; appalling makeover turns an aesthetically appealing UI into a tacky swap meet.</p></blockquote>
<p><em><span>This guy seems to miss the point. These themes are purely optional. That means if you don&#8217;t want them, you don&#8217;t have to have them. </span></em></p>
<blockquote><p>The advertiser themes are different, however, in that they won&#8217;t be foisted on unsuspecting users. Rather, you&#8217;ll have to download and install the ad pitch yourself. As a result, I doubt many Windows 7 users will gripe about ad themes. Hey, if you&#8217;re a Preparation H fan, why not devote the desktop to your favorite ointment?</p></blockquote>
<p><em><span>Must have been a slow week for this guy, or else the thought of Preparation H weighed heavily on his mind. But, it was not a total loss, 4 paragraphs into the piece, he admits it&#8217;s optional</span>.</em></p>
<blockquote><p>Nevertheless, I think ad themes are a bad idea. They may boost Microsoft&#8217;s bottom line a bit, but they run counter to Redmond&#8217;s grand scheme of creating an elegant Windows 7 experience.</p>
<p>Microsoft may have refuted the claims of its blabbermouth employee who told a British publication that <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/182080/windows_7_inspired_by_mac_heres_the_guy_who_said_so.html">Windows 7 cribbed its sleek appearance from Mac OS X</a>. (Bad career move there.) But any casual observer can tell that Windows has borrowed more than a few UI concepts from Apple over the years. I don&#8217;t see why things would change now.</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps all true, except for that word&#8230;elegant. Elegant? Microsoft? This must be the first time I have seen those words in any sort of proximity.</p>
<p>This author, who must be new to PCWorld, continues ranting about how Microsoft should lock down the desktop.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an idea. That will send user&#8217;s in droves to Linux,, or back to XP, where they can make the computer their own. Microsoft makes enough things difficult to change, it doesn&#8217;t need to further annoy the faithful, lest they become less than.</p>
<p>No, I think the ability to change things up is always good. So what if someone wants to have their desktop look like a billboard for Coke, it&#8217;s their desktop. The only thing I see wrong is that Microsoft is not offering any deals on things shown in the themes. (10% off a Coke, Pepsi, or perhaps an Infiniti purchase would be nice!)</p>
<p>And PCWorld, just because you&#8217;re still in print doesn&#8217;t mean that you always have good journalism, or journalistic practices&#8230; let&#8217;s get back to covering computers, software, and accessories, and leave the (inane) opinion pieces to a minimum.</p>
