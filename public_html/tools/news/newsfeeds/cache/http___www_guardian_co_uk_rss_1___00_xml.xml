Miliband again todayurged Obama to attend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will now be intense discussions on whether the political agreement at Copenhagen contains any detailed meaningful commitments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Denmark's prime minister, Lars Lokke Rasmussen, the host and chairman of the climate talks, flew overnight to Singapore to pitch the deferral plan to 19 leaders, including Obama and China's president, Hu Jintao, at an unscheduled event during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit. He insisted that the Copenhagen talks could still set political targets and outline commitments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given the time factor and the situation of individual countries we must, in the coming weeks, focus on what is possible and not let ourselves be distracted by what is not," Rasmussen told the leaders. "The Copenhagen agreement should finally mandate continued legal negotiations and set a deadline for their conclusion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama spoke in support of the proposal, cautioning the group not to let the "perfect be the enemy of the good", Froman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal by Denmark would buy time for the US Senate to pass carbon-capping legislation, allowing the Obama administration to bring a 2020 target and financing pledges to the table at a UN climate meeting in mid-2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are many other divisions between developed and developing nations that could prolong talks. It was unclear if China, the world's biggest emitter, and other developing countries supported the two-stage plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The level of international support may be clearer at a meeting on Monday of about 40 environment ministers in Copenhagen. Other governments said there was little choice. "Leaders were clear in their view that the current officials-led process is running into all sorts of difficulties, and therefore it is time for leaders, politically, to step in," Australia's prime minister, Kevin Rudd, told reporters after the meeting with Rasmussen. "It's going to be tough as all hell, but let me tell you I believe everyone is seeking, right now, to put their best foot forward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The development casts new significance on the summit in Beijing tomorrowbetween Obama and Hu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the UK government's former chief scientist Sir David King, these talks are the best chance for the world to agree a new deal. "Once Hu Jintao and Obama agree, I think the rest of the world could fall into place," he told the Guardian. "It's a head of state issue. Obama, through an agreement with Hu Jintao, could be able to deal with some of the concerns of the American population."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources close to the US-China talks are playing down the chances of a public breakthrough, saying only modest progress may be announced, in the area of clean technology cooperation. But signs of collaboration could unblock the logjam in the Senate and in international talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Copenhagen has come a year too early. There was no way Obama could get this together for December this year," said King. Chinese negotiators have been saying much the same thing in private.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;US officials are anxious about the timing of a likely announcement from China on its first carbon intensity target, thought to be around 40% to 45%reductions relative to economic growth by 2020. Although not internationally binding, a Chinese move could see the Obama administration blamed for a lack of progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extension is not unexpected given the downbeat statements by world leaders in recent weeks. But the delay has frustrated those who feel time is running out. "Heads of states must go beyond simply discussing the problems. They have to start solving them," said Diane McFadzien of the Worldwide Fund for Nature."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;â€¢ &lt;em&gt;For news and analysis of the UN climate talks in Copenhagen sign up for the Guardian's &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/blog/signup/2009/sep/30/green-light-email-sign-up?&amp;"&gt;environment email newsletter Greenlight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/copenhagen"&gt;Copenhagen climate change conference 2009&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barack-obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/china"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davidmiliband"&gt;David Miliband&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/davidadam"&gt;David Adam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jonathanwatts"&gt;Jonathan Watts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/patrickwintour"&gt;Patrick Wintour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.20.3/43270?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Barack+Obama+criticises+internet+censorship+at+meeting+in+China%3AArticle%3A1305560&amp;ch=World+news&amp;c3=GU.co.uk&amp;c4=China+%28News%29%2CUS+news%2CBarack+Obama+%28News%29%2CWorld+news&amp;c6=Tania+Branigan&amp;c7=09-Nov-16&amp;c8=1305560&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=News&amp;c11=World+news&amp;c13=&amp;c25=&amp;c30=content&amp;h2=GU%2FWorld+news%2FChina" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;US president praises freedom of expression as he speaks to Shanghai students at public meeting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barack Obama praised freedom of expression and political participation and criticised internet censorship as he spoke to students in Shanghai today, in the only public meeting scheduled for his three-day visit to China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US president told the gathering of around 300 young people that his country saw such liberties as universal rights. But he stopped short of direct reference to human rights abuses in China, as some activists had urged. Other issues raised in the question-and-answer session ranged from arms sales to Taiwan to his Nobel Peace Prize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China-watchers in the US have long encouraged their government to reach out to the country's public, as well as its leaders. But today's meeting underlined the difficulties of doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The event had been billed as a town hall style meeting, but &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/nov/12/obama-first-visit-of-china" title="Chinese officials rejected US proposals"&gt;Chinese officials rejected US proposals&lt;/a&gt; that 1,000 people should attend and that it should be broadcast live nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was streamed on the White House site, broadcast live on a local Shanghai television channel and transmitted in text form on state news agency Xinhua's website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Obama selected questioners from the audience himself, and answered inquiries from internet users, the students present were handpicked by officials at Shanghai institutions. The names of at least two questioners matched those of Communist Youth League officers at Fudan University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comments on internet censorship appeared on several Chinese news sites â€“ but rapidly disappeared from at least one, bloggers reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite that, one Twitter user wrote: "I will not forget this morning; I heard, on my shaky internet connection, a question about our own freedom which only a foreign leader can discuss."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But influential Chinese blogger Michael Anti wrote: "Except for the internet freedom Q&amp;A, Obama was too soft, carefully avoiding confronting China, so it made his town hall fail."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In brief opening remarks Obama repeated &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/nov/15/obama-japan-china-visit" title="earlier assurances"&gt;earlier assurances&lt;/a&gt; that America welcomed China's rise adding: "Because of our co-operation, the US and China are more prosperous and more secure."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He went on to highlight their differences, telling his audience: "We do not seek to impose any system of government on any other nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But we also don't believe that the principles that we stand for are unique to our nation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acknowledging America's own failings, he added: "These freedoms of expression, and worship, of access to information and political participation â€“ we believe they are universal rights. They should be available to all people, including ethnic and religious minorities, whether they are in the United States, China or any nation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about China's "Great Firewall" Obama described himself as "a big supporter of non-censorship" and said criticism enabled by freedom of expression in the US made him a better president.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Nicholas Bequelin, Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch, criticised Obama for framing liberties as a question of political culture rather than international legal norms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: "What's important is to put a degree of pressure on the Chinese government for its repressive practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You cannot do that without a degree of straight talk. That's not what happened at this meeting â€¦ What was needed was to include things relevant to what is happening in the country â€“ as he did in Cairo, for example."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aides have already said Obama will raise human rights in his meetings with Chinese leaders. Campaigners have reported that dozens of dissidents and activists have been detained ahead of his arrival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the most part, the president focused on a message of collaboration and suggested that the two countries now shared the "burden of leadership", with other nations waiting for them to move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are very few global challenges that can be solved unless the US and China agree," he told a questioner, citing climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama acknowledged yesterday that &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2009/nov/15/copenhagen-climate-deal-obama" title="time had run out to secure a legally binding deal at Copenhagen"&gt;time had run out to secure a legally binding deal at Copenhagen&lt;/a&gt; and backed plans to postpone a formal agreement until next year at earliest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But officials still hope for progress on the issue in the bilateral talks in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economic and trade issues will also be a high priority when Obama arrives in Beijing this afternoon for two days of talks, as will North Korea and Iran's nuclear programmes and the future of Afghanistan and Pakistan. He will hold meetings with Chinese president Hu Jintao and premier Wen Jiabao, and hold a joint press conference with Hu tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/china"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barack-obama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/taniabranigan"&gt;Tania Branigan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

It has involved thousands of police hours, specialist ancestral DNA analysis, and DNA tests on more than 2,000 individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police believe the attacker has carried out attacks on more than 108 elderly people, aged between 68 and 88, which were carried out in south-east London and date back to the early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incidents took place in clusters in south and south east London, including Dulwich, Orpington, Norwood, Downham, Lee, Croydon, West Wickham and Bickley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the past 17 years, the rapist has offended in patterns of a concentrated series of attacks, followed by a lull, which led detectives to speculate that he may have lived abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One profiler advising the police said the man was a "gerontophile", after some victims described how, even after horrific attacks, he had shown them tenderness and, in some cases, even apologised for his actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/ukcrime"&gt;Crime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/rape"&gt;Rape&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/london"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/sandralaville"&gt;Sandra Laville&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <title>Texas starts to doubt death row</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/nov/15/texas-death-penalty-execution-us</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.20.3/97614?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Texas+accounts+for+half+of+executions+in+US+%E2%80%93+but+now+has+doubts+over+de%3AArticle%3A1305503&amp;ch=World+news&amp;c3=Guardian&amp;c4=Capital+punishment+%28News%29%2CUS+news%2CUS+domestic+policy%2CWorld+news&amp;c6=Chris+McGreal&amp;c7=09-Nov-16&amp;c8=1305503&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=News&amp;c11=World+news&amp;c13=&amp;c25=&amp;c30=content&amp;h2=GU%2FWorld+news%2FCapital+punishment" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;Overturned convictions and growth of DNA forensic evidence shake state's rock-solid faith in capital punishment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in Texas they are having their doubts. The state that executes more people than any other by far â€“ it will account for half the prisoners sent to the death chamber in the US this year â€“ is seeing its once rock-solid faith in capital punishment shaken by overturned convictions, judicial scandals and growing evidence that at least one innocent man has been executed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growth of DNA forensic evidence has seen nearly 140 death row convictions overturned across the US, prompting abolition and moratoriums in other states that Texas has so far resisted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the public mood is swinging in the conservative state, which often seems to have an Old Testament view of justice. A former governor, Mark White â€“ previously a strong supporter of the death penalty â€“ has joined those calling for a reconsideration of capital punishment because of the risk of executing an innocent person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of death sentences passed by juries in Texas has fallen sharply in recent years, reflecting a retreat from capital punishment in many parts of America after DNA evidence led to the release of scores of condemned prisoners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of death sentences passed annually in the US has dropped by about 60% in the past decade, to around 100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In Texas we have seen a constant stream of individual cases that really destroy public faith and integrity in our criminal justice system," said Steve Hall, former chief of staff to the Texas attorney general for eight years, who is now an anti-death penalty activist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You are seeing that scepticism reflected in a lot of different ways. You are seeing juries more reluctant to issue death sentences. You are also seeing a different approach by district attorneys. Some are breaking with the past culture of seeking the death penalty whenever they can."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fortnight ago, two men sentenced to death and life in prison for the murder of four teenagers in 1991 were cleared after sophisticated forensic tests from the crime scene did not match either man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other prisoners are also being released after DNA evidence. In Dallas county alone, 24 people have been exonerated and the new district attorney has created a conviction integrity unit to examine other suspected miscarriages of justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recent attention has focused on a high profile case which may become the first officially acknowledged miscarriage of justice which led to a man being executed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The governor of Texas, Rick Perry, has been accused of gerrymandering a commission examining the evidence against Cameron Todd Willingham &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/oct/01/cameron-willingham-governor-perry-texas" title="who was executed in 2004 for the murder of his three young daughters"&gt;who was executed in 2004 for the murder of his three young daughters&lt;/a&gt; in an arson attack on his home. Perry abruptly replaced the chairman of the Texas Forensic Science Commission as it was about to hold hearings into a report by its own expert, who described the conviction as based on "junk science". The new chairman called off the hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other states have moved swiftly to address concerns about potential miscarriages of justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The release of four men in New Mexico prompted the governor, Bill Richardson, to abolish the death penalty in the state earlier this year, saying: "I do not have confidence in the criminal justice system as it currently operates to be the final arbiter when it comes to who lives and who dies for their crime."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six years ago, the governor of Illinois declared a moratorium on the death penalty after realising that the state had freed more men from death row than it had executed since 1976.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Death penalty supporters in Texas claim the numerous appeal processes protect against a wrongful conviction. "No one who's involved in criminal prosecution has ever claimed they are absolutely perfect," said Dudley Sharp, founder of a Texas victims rights group, Justice For All. "But with the death penalty in the United States you have a system that protects innocence to a greater degree than a life sentence ever could."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Hall says the highly politicised judicial system in Texas, with elected prosecutors and judges, is part of the problem. "One of the problems with having an elected judiciary is that you end up with judges who have to become good politicians. That means appealing to the voters. The presiding judge on the court of criminal appeals, Sharon Keller, ran as a pro-prosecution judge. That was her phrase," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keller - known has Sharon Killer to her critics because of her enthusiasm for the death penalty - is at the centre of a controversy that has further undermined confidence in the death penalty, after she &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/aug/17/sharon-keller-lethal-injection" title="refused to keep a court office open after 5pm"&gt;refused to keep a court office open after 5pm&lt;/a&gt; to allow a last-minute appeal for a stay of execution while the supreme court decided on another case that affected all executions in Texas. The convict, Michael Richard, was executed hours later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keller is awaiting a verdict from the State Commission on Judicial Conduct on charges of dereliction of duty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Keller turned down an appeal from a man on the brink of execution, despite revelations that the judge and prosecutor at his trial had been having an affair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/capital-punishment"&gt;Capital punishment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usdomesticpolicy"&gt;US domestic policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/chrismcgreal"&gt;Chris McGreal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <title>'The purpose of life is to avoid boredom'</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2009/nov/16/michael-winner-restaurants-death-boredom</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.20.3/35961?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Michael+Winner%3A+%27The+only+purpose+of+life+is+to+avoid+boredom%27%3AArticle%3A1304965&amp;ch=Film&amp;c3=Guardian&amp;c4=Film%2CRestaurants+%28Life+and+style%29%2CCelebrity&amp;c6=Stephen+Moss+%28Guardian+staff+writer%29&amp;c7=09-Nov-16&amp;c8=1304965&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=Feature%2CInterview&amp;c11=Film&amp;c13=The+G2+interview+%28series%29&amp;c25=&amp;c30=content&amp;h2=GU%2FFilm%2FRestaurants" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;The notorious film director on cheating death, the awfulness of restaurants â€“ and how he can't stand boring people&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is with a mixture of fear and exhilaration that I approach Michael Winner's large house â€“ he likes to describe it as a mansion â€“ in London's fashionable Holland Park. God knows how much it's worth â€“ Â£25m maybe. Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin lives next door, in an even bigger house. An attractive, slightly forbidding young woman answers the door â€“ I later discover she is a resting actress called Ruby â€“ and she shows me into Winner's private cinema, filled with memorabilia from half a lifetime of movie-making and an entire lifetime of trouble-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are seats for 30 people, a bar, a director's chair with Winner's name on it, the Winner puppet from Spitting Image, a signed photograph of Marilyn Monroe, pictures of some scantily clad starlets, and hundreds of photographs of stars he has worked with â€“ Orson Welles, Marlon Brando, Burt Lancaster, Michael Caine, Roger Moore. It is a strange, disorientating room, very hot and stuffy, and only adds to my sense of trepidation. I always enjoy Winner's bonkers restaurant reviews in the Sunday Times, but I don't think I'd want to go to dinner with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ruby brings me a glass of water â€“ oddly for so grand an establishment nothing else is offered â€“ and I wait. About 10 minutes later, there is a low rumbling outside the door and Winner appears, wearing what appears to be military uniform, though he tells me later it's some sort of formal Scottish jacket he bought recently. He also explains why he had asked Ruby to close the door of the cinema: he didn't want me to see the difficulty he had coming down the stairs. He was desperately ill in 2007 with a bacterial infection caused by the flesh-eating bug &lt;em&gt;Vibrio vulnificus&lt;/em&gt; â€“ he contracted it after eating oysters in Barbados â€“ and it has left his left leg permanently weakened. I notice his right hand is shaking, too, and when he poses for a photograph later he holds it stiffly, proudly. He is 74, white-haired, not very mobile, but refuses to give in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had been intrigued by a recent letter in the Guardian, from a cousin of Winner's. The cousin had taken exception to him saying, in a Q&amp;A in the paper, "I didn't like my cousins at all . . . I found them extremely boring." A sharp tongue must run in the family because the cousin had written: "Mr Winner does not know his cousins well enough to pronounce them boring. Most have led purposeful lives, relatively free from name-dropping, rudeness and needy self-promotion." "I don't know who the fuck he is," says Winner, raising the subject before I get the chance. "I was going to write to him and say, 'Well, could you tell me the ones who didn't lead purposeful lives, and what did they do to meet your downgrading?'" What about the alleged name-dropping, rudeness and needy self-promotion?  "Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks," he says. "The only one that pisses me off is when people say name-dropping. Everybody talks about the people they meet and who are part of their lives. It's quite normal. Well, I'm very sorry, but I have led my life among famous people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had mainly wanted to meet Winner, on the somewhat spurious pretext that he is publishing a restaurant guide called Winner's Dinners, because of what he had said in that Q&amp;A about growing up, in this very house, which was at the time divided into flats.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;He adored his businessman father, but had what he called a "love-hate relationship" with his mother, a brilliant but terrifying woman â€“ "the only person in my whole life I've ever been frightened of" â€“ who was addicted to gambling. I wanted to hear more about this strange, dysfunctional family, and in particular about his mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"She was a searing woman, a lovely woman, a dangerous woman," says Winner. "She stole Â£8m from me in the 70s to pay her gambling debts. She sold pictures, antiques and jade from the house that today would be worth a minimum Â£50m, but who cares, she was happy. She spent 11 years trying to sue me, ran through 10 firms of solicitors who said she had no case at all, and when they went to a QC and he said, 'Mr Winner has done nothing wrong â€“ he cannot possibly be sued', my mother said to the solicitor, 'Sue the QC.' She was what they call a character." With that he is overwhelmed by one of the gales of high-pitched laughter that punctuate his conversation. "She was very charming, very sparkly, but could turn on a sixpence," he says when he has recovered, "and when she turned I've seen grown men quake."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gambling was her sole interest. "When I was 14 I was already writing a showbusiness column," recalls Winner, "and I remember saying to her one day, 'You know, mother, I had dinner with Louis Armstrong last night at the Washington Hotel in Curzon Street.' 'Oh darling,' she said, 'how interesting.' Then she turned and said, 'You know, Mrs Becher had a six of clubs and Mrs Cohen had an eight of spades . . .' She was always a congenital gambler. It was a sickness, the same as drugs or alcohol."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winner was an only child and admits he was lonely. His parents were Jewish â€“ his mother was born in Poland and his father had Russian antecedents â€“ and he was educated at the St Christopher School in Letchworth, a progressive establishment with a Quaker heritage. He says he found neither society congenial. "I didn't fit in with the Shavian sandal-wearers at school, and I didn't fit in with the rather flash Jews in London, so I created my own world of going to the cinema, writing about cinema and eventually meeting artists. I was a loner; I still am a loner. People say,  'You must go to dinner a lot.' I don't. I hardly ever go out. Why do I want to go out and sit with some boring people?" People he considers boring are his great bugbear. "The only purpose of life is to avoid boredom," he says. "Madness is the greatest thing. Sane, ordinary people, God bless them, [theatrical pause] bollocks. Bollocks to them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winner's conversation is entertaining but unstructured, full of expletives, invective, riotous laughter and random anecdotes. I try to get him back on track. How important is his Jewishness? "I don't do Jewish," he says, "not that I'm ashamed of it, I just don't. I went to a Quaker school, then to Cambridge [to study law and economics]. My father was on the board of the New West End Synagogue, which is the orthodox synagogue, and I paid for a seat there for ever, out of respect for him, though on high days and holy days I'm quite sure they sell my seat twice. If I went and said, 'I've been paying for this seat for 40 years, I'd like to sit down and do a bit of praying', they'd say, 'Too bad, Mr Winner, there's somebody sitting there.' I don't go, but I know what I am."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thinking about his father prompts a sudden moment of introspection: "My deepest regret in life is that I didn't spend more time with my parents, and show them more sympathy and respect. Whatever problem mother was, she was my mother." I say that, from what I've heard, Winner and his mother are cast from the same mould. His reply suggests he agrees. "George Bernard Shaw said, 'It is better for a parent to be a horrible warning than a good example.' Not infrequently I see myself going in a certain direction, and I say, 'Hang on, that's like your mother, pull back.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A life in cinema&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winner says he wanted to be a director from the age of four. "I used to do shadow plays on the wall, shine lights through bits of coloured sweet paper. I remember I was sitting on a toilet when I was about five and there was a girl on a potty, and I'd just had one of my shows, so I said, 'How do you like my film?' She said, 'I hated it.' That was my first critic, on a potty."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Cambridge, which he says he only attended at his parents' insistence, he worked briefly for the BBC as a "call boy". "Now they call it assistant floor manager or some shit â€“ everyone has fucking titles now. But you basically went on the door and said, 'We're ready.' I always remember, I was with some afternoon programme, and some old woman in the show said, [imitates upper-class voice] 'Oh, will you go back to the dressing-room and get my handbag please.' And I thought some poor arsehole is going to have to get her handbag. Well, it was me of course."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the BBC he made cinema shorts (with his father's money), documentaries and, from 1960 on, full-length features. Critics have not always been kind about Winner's movies â€“ the girl on the potty was prescient â€“ and he hasn't made a film for 10 years. But he reckons at least half a dozen â€“ The System, The Jokers, I'll Never Forget What's'isname, Lawman, Chato's Land, The Nightcomers â€“ were very good, and that there are hints his career is being re-evaluated. "They're beginning to come back to it," he says. "I'll Never Forget What's'isname played the National Film Theatre the other day. I gave a lecture after it. Packed, &lt;em&gt;packed&lt;/em&gt;, you couldn't get in. And this was not in the peak evening time. &lt;em&gt;PACKED&lt;/em&gt;. They're being recognised again now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His best-known film is Death Wish, made in 1974. "In America, they give lectures on it," he says. "It's the first film in the history of cinema where a civilian goes out and kills civilians, and is the hero. It was only made because I was going to Kennedy airport with Charlie Bronson, having finished a film called The Stone Killer, and Charlie said to me, 'What should we do next?' I said, 'Charlie, I've had a script for some time called Death Wish. I can't get it going. It's about a man whose wife and daughter are mugged, and he goes out and kills muggers. So Charlie Bronson says, 'I'd like to do that.' I said, 'The film?' He said, 'No, I'd like to kill muggers.' So as a result of that we went to Dino de Laurentiis, who was Italian and not hidebound, and the film got made."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does he miss making films? "Of course," he says, "but there are very few 74-year-old film directors about. You have to live in the real world. The spotlight moves. You can't expect to make top Hollywood films all your life. I ran as a very much employed director from 1960 to 1990, and then it started to crumble. But it does, it does. I had a good 30 years, and then in the 90s I made three or four films. Dirty Weekend was a very good film." I say  I will take his word for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His triumph has been to reinvent himself: as a restaurant critic; as the face of insurance company esure â€“ the "calm down, dear" commercials that he directed and starred in became a cult; and now as a TV presenter. He is filming a series for ITV, to be screened next spring, called Michael Winner's Dining Stars, in which he goes to the homes of members of the public, has a meal and passes judgment on their cooking. It sounds nightmarish. "It's basically me being myself," he says. "We have no scriptwriters, it depends entirely on me." So it's all about the human interaction, I suggest. "If you choose to call me human, yes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says Peter Fincham, director of television at ITV, is keen on the series and wants to give it a peak evening slot. Winner, though, is not counting his chickens. "We have a saying in the movie business: every film is a great success until it's released. 'Oh, she's never been better, this actress.' 'Oh, the scenery, the script.' Goes out in the cinemas, two dogs see it because they've got nowhere else to have a piss. So at the moment this show is a great success."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Women, death and restaurants &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winner shares his beloved mansion, which he intends to leave to the state as a museum, with Geraldine Lynton-Edwards, a former dancer in her late 60s with whom he has had an on-off affair for more than 50 years (he admits to dating several hundred other women in the "off" periods). They finally got engaged in 2007, in the wake of his illness, though the wedding does not appear to be imminent. "It took me 72 years to get engaged, so don't hold your breath for the marriage," is his stock response. But why has he never married? "If you haven't married at 74 and you're not gay, which people used to say I was and probably some still do, there's obviously something in the mind that isn't fully functioning," he says. "I don't know why. Some girls say it's because of your mother, because you won't commit, because you're afraid of alimony."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is he perhaps a bit of a misogynist? "What does that mean?" he asks. That you don't really like women and want to keep them in their place. "No, no, I absolutely adore women," he says. "Women are much nicer people than men. They're more sensitive, more forthright." So why, I ask him, has he been so horrible about Selina Scott, making fun of her for saying Channel 5 discriminated against her on the grounds of age. "When I say I like women, it doesn't mean that I have to like every woman. And I don't even dislike Selina Scott. I just think her attitude on this ageism business is absolute rubbish. She's saying that every old person has to be kept in the job till they die. It's unbelievable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not that Winner is showing any signs of stepping aside, despite the effects of his illness. "They cut away about 15% of my leg, including three key balancing tendons. I am crippled, end of story." The miracle was that he survived at all. "I was pronounced dead five times, had 19 full-anaesthetic operations in three months, and this year I had a similar thing again. Nobody thought my leg would stay on. They had warned me my leg might come off, but I didn't believe them. I thought, 'I'm not a person who walks with one leg, how can my leg come off?' But it was very, very close."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does this feel like a second chance? "I'm still here," he says, "but I'm not complete. You just get on with it as best you can." He denies that his engagement to Lynton-Edwards was the result of the illness, but the way she nursed him through it clearly touched him. "She was so incredible while I was in hospital. I was in for three months and then had three months more at home when everything went wrong. She was so devoted, and her goodness, which I already knew, shone through." Has the proximity of death changed him? "People say, 'Did you learn anything?' I say, 'Yes. Illness is a nuisance and extreme illness is a fucking nuisance. That's all you can say. You don't see God, you don't see lights. Five times I was more or less gone. They called Geraldine back at three in the morning once and said, 'He's going.'" Being Winner, he refused to leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He makes a tentative effort to encourage me to talk about the book â€“ there are several thousand copies in the hallway â€“ and lets me in on a secret. "I don't like restaurants. How could anybody like them? They say it's the hospitality industry. The most inhospitable people in the world work in restaurants. It draws them in like a magnet. The minute you go in, the receptionist looks up and says, 'Have you got a reservation?' She doesn't smile and say, 'Good evening.' Until you have a reservation, you're a non-person." Restaurants must quake when he turns up, I venture. "In that case, why do I get given burned food," he complains. "Why is the service so dreadful? I wish they did quake. Do they quake? The answer is not enough, not enough."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meeting him has, despite my fears and his occasional shoutiness, been a huge pleasure. "It's lovely to see you, lovely to see you," he says warmly at the end. He then spends half an hour shouting at the photographer, insisting on staring directly into the lens, refusing to be shot from below. "Orson Welles once said to me, 'Michael, you're shooting me from below,' he recalls. 'That will make me look fat.' Orson would have looked fat if you'd shot him from a helicopter." Pause for another squall of laughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has to sit in the hall for a few minutes while the photographer sets up in the garden. Just for a moment, head bowed, he looks worn down by his illness. But when the photographer calls, he springs to attention. "What's that line in Sunset Boulevard?" I say as he hobbles out through the doorway. "Ready for your close-up," he responds immediately. And so he is, standing proudly beside the banana plant in his beautiful garden, performing once more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Michael Winner's favourite things&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book&lt;/strong&gt; I've only read one book in the last seven years. It's called Walter the Farting Dog. My fiancee gave it to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Film&lt;/strong&gt; The Third Man, no question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TV show&lt;/strong&gt; Has to be Fawlty Towers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shop&lt;/strong&gt; I don't like shops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Song&lt;/strong&gt; Five Little Miles from San Berdoo. Jane Russell sang it in a movie. It's the most stupid song ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;View&lt;/strong&gt; From my bedroom. On the north side you see the garden, which we floodlight with 168 floodlights, and on the other side you see Jimmy Page's house, which I've also floodlit. If he objects, I'll turn it off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Place to go on holiday&lt;/strong&gt; The Villa Feltrinelli on Lake Garda, which was Mussolini's last home before he left it and got shot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restaurant&lt;/strong&gt; The River CafÃ©.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meal&lt;/strong&gt; A good old English fry-up: fried bread, fried eggs, sausages, tomatoes, black pudding. Michel Blanc at Le Manoir does a very good English fry-up, and he's French.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/restaurants"&gt;Restaurants&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/celebrity"&gt;Celebrity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/stephenmoss"&gt;Stephen Moss&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <title>PCC chair attacks 'super-injunctions'</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/nov/15/pcc-lady-buscombe-super-injunctions</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.20.3/53700?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=PCC+chair+attacks+%27super-injunctions%27%3AArticle%3A1305461&amp;ch=Media&amp;c3=Guardian&amp;c4=PCC+%28media%29%2CPeta+Buscombe%2CMedia+law%2CMedia%2CThe+Guardian+%28Media%29%2CTrafigura%2CPolitics%2CLaw+%28News%29%2CUK+news&amp;c6=Chris+Tryhorn&amp;c7=09-Nov-16&amp;c8=1305461&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=News&amp;c11=Media&amp;c13=&amp;c25=&amp;c30=content&amp;h2=GU%2FMedia%2FPress+Complaints+Commission" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;â€¢ Lady Buscombe calls on government to curb use&lt;br /&gt;â€¢ Gagging orders condemned as 'anathema to democracy'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chair of the Press Complaints Commission has defended its role as an independent watchdog and attacked so-called "super-injunctions" to keep legal action against the press secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her first major speech in the job, the Conservative peer Lady Buscombe condemned the use of super-injunctions as "anathema to democracy".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trafigura affair â€“ in which an oil trading firm tried unsuccessfully to prevent the Guardian from reporting a parliamentary question about its activities â€“ demonstrated the power of social media sites such as Twitter and why statutory regulation of the press was unfeasible, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the long term, those who want to impose legal restrictions on the media are not just on the wrong side of the argument about freedom of expression, they are also on the wrong side of history," she told newspaper editors and executives at a Society of Editors conference in Stansted, Essex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In a world where individuals can communicate en masse and bypass traditional media altogether, it is just no longer possible to restrict the free flow of information from the top down. The sooner that regulators, legislators and lawyers realise this the better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She called on the government to curb the use of super-injunctions. "The idea that a judge who may be no expert in the field can dish out so-called super-injunctions â€“ preventing us from even knowing that he or she has restrained publication â€“ is insulting to the public and anathema to democracy," she said. "How did it ever come to this? As a parliamentarian, I do not recall ever debating this proposition, or agreeing that lawyers could scuttle off to the high court in order to keep true but embarrassing information out of the public domain. Nor do I recall it being suggested that parliament would be prevented by the law itself from scrutinising how the law was developing.  This is a constitutional outrage. Now that the secret is out, the government must do something about it without delay."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buscombe, who became PCC chairman in April, said that self-regulation worked "on the basis of good old-fashioned common sense".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rounding on critics such as former deputy prime minister John Prescott, who has attacked "do-it-yourself regulation" of the press, she said: "The press do not regulate themselves. The PCC is funded by the newspaper and magazine industry but operates independently of it. Its independence is guaranteed by a majority of lay members, and staff who have no vested interest in siding with the press. Is that really so difficult a concept to grasp?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said the watchdog could provide a conduit for anger about controversial media coverage such as an article about the death of Boyzone star Stephen Gately by the Daily Mail's Jan Moir. "To those who have recently signed a petition on the No 10 website urging the government to put the PCC on a statutory footing, I say: be careful what you wish for," she said. "When there is â€“ in the PCC â€“ already a channel to express dismay that a paper has overstepped the line, do people want a government body telling us what we can read and think?" She also contrasted "bloated bureaucracies" in other industries with the PCC's staff of 14 and annual budget of Â£1.9m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PCC came under fire last week from the editor of the Guardian, Alan Rusbridger, who branded its report on phone hacking at the News of the World "worse than pointless". He suggested the PCC might need to be better funded "so that it has some investigatory mechanism".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buscombe rejected this suggestion, saying she was surprised "to hear a call from some of those who are benefiting from this historic shift [to social media, in the Trafigura case] for the PCC to be reconstituted as some sort of formal regulator with quasi-legal powers".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In this new environment, frameworks of good practice, coupled with easy, accessible complaints mechanisms are the way to keep standards high." She said the PCC was not complacent, however, and was undergoing a review of its governance structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pcc"&gt;Press Complaints Commission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/peta-buscombe"&gt;Peta Buscombe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/medialaw"&gt;Media law&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/theguardian"&gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/trafigura-probo-koala"&gt;Trafigura&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/law"&gt;Law&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/christryhorn"&gt;Chris Tryhorn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

Until now, only one other site in Europe and three in the US, in Utah, Pennsylvania and Ohio, have been chosen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Galloway Forest park was selected because of its darkness, its accessibility to the public and the determination of its owners, the Forestry Commission, to protect it against the light pollution that blots out the Milky Way to 90% of the British population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The International Dark Skies Association tested levels of darkness in the park using a sky quality meter, which would give a photographer's darkroom 24 â€“ the highest reading possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The park got 23, while the reading in cities such as Glasgow would be 15 or 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin Morgan-Taylor, the International Dark Skies Association's British board member, said the park's remoteness from the light pollution of large towns meant night clouds were darker than the night sky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The dark sky park concept is really about restoring and protecting the night sky," he said. "It's an award for effort and commitment as much as its quality as a dark sky."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The accessibility of Galloway Forest park to amateur astronomers and visitors living in northern England, central Scotland and Northern Ireland â€“ the ferry port of Stranraer is close by â€“ meant it was able to promote astronomy and the dark skies ethos more effectively than far more remote areas of Britain, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's going to be beautiful and an incredible educational tool," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If schoolchildren can't see the night sky at home, they may never develop an interest in astronomy or any other science, because they can't look up and see something which will spark their interest."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Alexander runs a B&amp;B near Wigtown, which caters for amateur astronomers, and also runs "star camps" near Wigtown Bay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the area benefited greatly from clean, unpolluted winds blowing in from the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key issue was "the sheer lack of people," he said, adding: "Unfortunately, people pollute the sky with light: they want street lights, bright lights outside their houses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/astronomy"&gt;Astronomy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/severincarrell"&gt;Severin Carrell&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <title>Brown: we will never appease Taliban</title>

      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.20.3/15012?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Gordon+Brown%3A+we+will+never+accept+calls+to+appease+Taliban%3AArticle%3A1305517&amp;ch=Politics&amp;c3=GU.co.uk&amp;c4=Gordon+Brown%2CAl-Qaida+%28News%29%2CTaliban%2CMilitary+UK%2CAfghanistan+%28News%29%2CDavid+Miliband%2CHamid+Karzai+%28News%29%2CPolitics%2CWorld+news%2CUK+news&amp;c6=Patrick+Wintour&amp;c7=09-Nov-16&amp;c8=1305517&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=News&amp;c11=Politics&amp;c13=&amp;c25=&amp;c30=content&amp;h2=GU%2FPolitics%2FGordon+Brown" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gordon Brown will claim today that more has been done to disable al-Qaida this year than in any year since the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His remarks are designed to bolster waning support for the war as a Comres poll in the Independent on Sunday showed 71% of the British public want troops to leave Afghanistan within a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a speech at the lord mayor's banquet, the annual foreign policy address by the prime minister, Brown will promise never to succumb to calls for appeasement, or "subordinate the international good to the mood of the passing moment".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News of his defiant mood came as the Ministry of Defence said another British serviceman had been killed in Helmand province, and days before the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, is inaugurated for another term as president following his controversial re-election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The soldier, who was shot while on foot patrol, was from 7th Battalion The Rifles, attached to the 3rd Battalion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Miliband, the foreign secretary, will travel to Kabul for Karzai's inauguration after making his own speech defending British involvement tomorrow. He is expected to focus on the need for Karzai's government to break out of a cycle of corruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his speech Brown will again say there is a direct link between Afghanistan and the threat posed by al-Qaida to the security of the UK. Successive polls show that the British public are sceptical that al-Qaida needs the base of a Taliban-run Afghanistan to pose a serious terrorist threat to the west. The latest MoD figures showed that more than 1,000 seriously wounded or sick British troops have been flown back to the UK this year, a record number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many strategists argue the true threat to the UK lies in Pakistan, but Brown will say: "We are in Afghanistan because we judge that if the Taliban regained power al-Qaida and other terrorist groups would once more have an environment in which they could operate. We are there because action in Afghanistan is not an alternative to action in Pakistan, but an inseparable support to it.  "Make no mistake, al-Qaida has an extensive recruitment network across Africa the Middle East, western Europe - and in the UK. We know that there are still several hundred foreign fighters based in the Fata [tribal] area of Pakistan travelling to training camps to learn bomb making and weapons skills. Al-Qaida also has links to the Afghan and Pakistan Taliban."He will add that "since 2001                                          nearly 200 people have been convicted of terrorist or terrorist-related offences in Britain", adding almost half pleaded guilty..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partly due to greater co-operation from the Pakistan military, he will report"   "more has been planned and enacted with greater success in this one year to disable al-Qaida than in any year since the original invasion in 2001."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Describing  al-Qaida as "the biggest source of threat to our national security"  he will promise "vigilance in defence of national security will never be sacrificed to expediency. Necessary resolution will never succumb to appeasement. The greater international good will never be subordinated to the mood of the passing moment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He will also  argue that Afghanistan shows the need for the UK to run an optimistic and engaged foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an implicit rebuff of the Tories' isolationist stand on Europe, he will argue: "At every point in our history where we have looked outwards, we have become stronger. And now, more than ever, there is no future in what was once called 'splendid isolation'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/gordon-brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/al-qaida"&gt;Al-Qaida&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/taliban"&gt;Taliban&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/military"&gt;Military&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davidmiliband"&gt;David Miliband&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/hamid-karzai"&gt;Hamid Karzai&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/patrickwintour"&gt;Patrick Wintour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

"Sorry that, as children, you were taken from your families and placed in institutions where so often you were abused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sorry for the physical suffering, the emotional starvation and the cold absence of love, of tenderness, of care."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government records show that at least 150,000 children aged between three and 14 were sent to Commonwealth countries, mainly Australia and Canada, in a programme that began in the 1920s and did not end until 1967.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The children â€“ the majority of whom were already in some form of social or charitable care â€“ were cut off from their families and even falsely informed that they were orphans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents were told the children had gone to a better life, but many of them ended up in institutions or were sent to work unpaid on farms, with many facing abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 7,000 survivors of the programme live in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Let us resolve this day that this national apology becomes a turning point in our nation's story," Rudd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A turning point for shattered lives, a turning point for governments at all levels and of every political hue and colour to do all in our power to never allow this to happen again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Downing Street spokeswoman said Brown would apologise in the new year, following consultation with charities representing former child migrants and their families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a letter to a Labour MP who has campaigned on the issue, the prime minister said that the "time is now right" for an apology, adding: "It is important that we take the time to listen to the voices of the survivors and victims of these misguided policies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rudd also offered a wider apology to the estimated 500,000 children who suffered in state care in Australia between 1930 and 1970.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, he &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/feb/13/australia" title="made a landmark apology"&gt;made a landmark apology&lt;/a&gt; to the "stolen generations" of aboriginal children who were forcibly removed from their parents in a strategy of white assimilation that was not abandoned until 1970.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/canada"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/gordon-brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/children"&gt;Children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/adam-gabbatt"&gt;Adam Gabbatt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

This reform goes further by giving the Financial Services Authority (FSA) the power to rewrite individual contracts â€“ and not just in banks in which the government has a stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, City experts doubted the FSA would be able to tell from studying often-opaque individual discretionary bonus contracts whether they encouraged excessive risk-taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downing Street officials admit the Queen's speech is the start of a critical three weeks for the prime minister, Gordon Brown, in which they will try to hammer home the political dividing lines with the Tories, culminating in the publication of the pre-budget report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Downing Street bunker believes its fortunes have improved in the last fortnight, but acknowledges there is no recovery in the opinion polls. A YouGov poll in the Sunday Times put the Conservatives on 41%, with Labour on 27%, the Lib Dems at 18% and others on 14%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No 10 disputed suggestions that the Queen's speech was thin or that few of the controversial new laws would reach the statute book due to the lack of parliamentary time before the general election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labour hopes to use the speech to show it has an optimistic agenda and a conviction that government can be a force for good in creating fairness and an economic recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the spotlight growing on Cameron by the week, Labour hopes to present the Tory party with awkward dilemmas on what measures it should oppose, therefore revealing more about the Conservative view of the small state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With social care policies likely to be its focus later in the week, No 10 today highlighted an approach to the bonuses of individual traders which was more populist than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myners said on Sky News: "It is very clear that contracts that contain bonus clauses which will add to risk, or contracts which guarantee bonuses for several years, are no longer acceptable and, if those contracts are written, they will be voided under law." The aim, he said, was not to set caps on individual bonuses, but "to de-risk the system".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new rules would only apply to new contracts, so would have no effect on Christmas bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The level of bonuses remained the responsibility of boards and institutional investors, Myners said. "What we are saying to the shareholders and boards of directors is: get real, recognise that the previous levels of bonuses are socially unacceptable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He claimed he had the support of senior people in banking for the measures to bring responsibility back to remuneration, but the British Bankers Association warned the changes could harm Britain's status as a global financial centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phillip Hammond, the shadow treasury chief secretary, said: "This looks like yet more headline chasing from the government.Over a year ago, the FSA said they had the power to sign off on the framework and structure of bonuses. The public will be asking what this announcement means for the bonuses that are due to be paid this Christmas â€“ and the answer is nothing at all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He repeated his call for regulation to become the responsibility of the Bank of England, rather than the FSA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No 10 is billing the Queen's speech as an appeal to the mainstream middle in which Labour will offer a "smart state" giving the public guarantees that would not be available in Cameron's smaller state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Party strategists said Wednesday's big offers include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;â€¢ A guaranteed education or training place for young people up to 18; and a job or training place for 18- to 24-year-olds who have been out of work for a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;â€¢ Guaranteed diagnosis within one week for patients suspected by their GP of having cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;â€¢ Free personal care at home for those with high needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;â€¢ No-nonsense intervention to tackle 50,000 problem families.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;â€¢ A legally enforced commitment to cut the deficit in half in four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Labour attack line on the Conservatives suggests Cameron will:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;â€¢ Give a Â£200,000 tax cut to the 3,000 wealthiest estates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;â€¢ Cut Â£1,000 in child trust fund payments from families earning modest incomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;â€¢ Scrap guarantees for cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;â€¢ Cut schools' funding from next year and offer only a gamble â€“ not a guarantee â€“ for young people out of work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;â€¢ Cut the equivalent of 3,500 police this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/executive-pay-bonuses"&gt;Executive pay and bonuses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/queens-speech"&gt;Queen's speech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/paul-myners"&gt;Paul Myners&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/regulators"&gt;Regulators&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/banking"&gt;Banking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/labour"&gt;Labour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/financial-services-authority-fsa"&gt;Financial Services Authority (FSA)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/gordon-brown"&gt;Gordon Brown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/conservatives"&gt;Conservatives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/patrickwintour"&gt;Patrick Wintour&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.20.3/60600?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Pro-Israel+lobby+group+bankrolling+Tories%2C+film+claims%3AArticle%3A1305507&amp;ch=Politics&amp;c3=Guardian&amp;c4=Conservatives%2CParty+funding%2CPolitics%2CMiddle+East+%28News%29%2CWorld+news%2CChannel+4%2CTelevision+industry+%28Media%29%2CMedia%2CDavid+Cameron%2CWilliam+Hague%2CUK+news&amp;c6=Ian+Black&amp;c7=09-Nov-16&amp;c8=1305507&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=News&amp;c11=Politics&amp;c13=&amp;c25=&amp;c30=content&amp;h2=GU%2FPolitics%2FConservatives" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;50% of MPs in the shadow cabinet are Conservative Friends of Israel members, according to Channel 4's Dispatches&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pro-Israeli organisations in Britain look set to see their influence increase if the Conservatives win the next election, a film scrutinising the activities of a powerful but little-known lobby warns today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least half of the shadow cabinet are members of the Conservative Friends of Israel (CFI), according to a Dispatches programme being screened on Channel 4. The programme-makers describe the CFI as "beyond doubt the most well- connected and probably the best funded of all Westminster lobbying groups".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside Britain's Israel Lobby claims that donations to the Conservative party "from all CFI members and their businesses add up to well over Â£10m over the last eight years". CFI has disputed the figure and called the film "deeply flawed".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The programme also describes how David Cameron allegedly accepted a Â£15,000 donation from Poju Zabludowicz, a Finnish billionaire who chairs Bicom (the Britain Israel Communications and Research Centre). Zabludowizc, the film reveals, has business interests in an illegal West Bank settlement. He also gave Â£50,000 to Conservative Central Office. Zabludowicz says his contributions "are a matter of public record".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;William Hague allegedly accepted personal donations from CFI board members totalling tens of thousands of pounds after being appointed shadow foreign secretary. More than Â£30,000 from CFI supporters went to the campaign funds of members of Cameron's team who were first elected in 2005, the film claims, using publicly available information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The programme-makers say that while this is legal, it is not well-known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CFI director, Stuart Polak, told the Guardian the figure of more than Â£10m is not supported by any facts. "It is fictitious, misleading and damaging to the reputation of CFI and its supporters," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"CFI as an organisation has donated only Â£30,000 since 2005. Each of these donations has been made transparently and publicly registered. In addition to this Â£30,000, it is undoubtedly the case that some of our supporters have also chosen, separately, to donate to the party as individuals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago a controversial study by American academics Stephen Walt and John Mearsheimer explored the influence of the Israel lobby over US foreign policy. But Britain's pro-Israel organisations have been subjected to far less scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The pro-Israel lobby â€¦ is the most powerful political lobby," Michael Mates, a Conservative MP and privy councillor, told the film-makers. "There's nothing to touch them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hague fell out with CFI after describing Israel's 2006 attack on Lebanon â€“ in retaliation for a Hezbollah raid â€“ as "disproportionate" and allegedly faced threats to withdraw funding from Lord Kalms, a major Tory donor and CFI member, the film reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cameron later gave an undertaking not to use the word again, the programme claims. At a CFI dinner this June the party leader made no mention of the death toll in the Gaza war â€“ 1,370 Palestinians and 13 Israelis. Instead he commended Israel because "it strives to protect innocent life".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sir Richard Dalton, a former British diplomat who served as consul-general in Jerusalem and ambassador to Libya and Iran, said: "I don't believe, and I don't think anybody else believes these contributions come with no strings attached."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labour Friends of Israel, another key group, is described as being "less unquestioning in its support of the Israeli government than CFI". But it has taken more MPs on free trips to Israel than any other group â€“ more than 60 since 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CFI has also flown over 30 Tory parliamentary candidates to Israel on free trips in the last three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dispatches describes how when the presenter Jonathan Dimbleby criticised a pro-Israel campaign against the BBC's Middle East editor, Jeremy Bowen, Dimbleby was the subject of a complaint and, according to the programme, is now under investigation by the BBC Trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bicom, like the party-affiliated groups, organises briefings and trips to Israel for journalists, including Guardian staff. It sought to dismiss the significance of Zabludowicz's interest in a shopping mall in Ma'aleh Adumim, a settlement built on territory occupied in the 1967 war and which Israel would hope to retain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Binyamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, has rebuffed demands by Barack Obama for a settlement freeze.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bicom's chief executive, Lorna Fitzsimons, said: "The private business interests of any of our funders â€“ including our chairman â€“ have absolutely no impact on Bicom's work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are an independent organisation and we guard our reputation fiercely. We work with journalists to help them better understand the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We show Israel, warts and all, from the left to the right and we have a strict policy that on every journalist trip we go to the Palestinian Authority to give journalists unfettered access to Palestinian voices."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/conservatives"&gt;Conservatives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/partyfunding"&gt;Party funding&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/middleeast"&gt;Middle East&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/channel4"&gt;Channel 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/television"&gt;Television industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/davidcameron"&gt;David Cameron&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/williamhague"&gt;William Hague&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/ianblack"&gt;Ian Black&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Barack Obama says that time has run out to secure a binding climate deal at Copenhagen. Environment correspondent &lt;strong&gt;Jonathan Watts&lt;/strong&gt; explains what the US president is proposing instead, to prevent next month's talks ending in complete failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the US state of Texas prepares to implement the death penalty three times this week, &lt;strong&gt;Chris McGreal &lt;/strong&gt;reports on growing demands for a moratorium on executions there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matthew Taylor&lt;/strong&gt; looks at the resurgence in the popularity of boxing. Once damned as dangerous and barbaric, politicians now say it instils self esteem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Madoff memorabilia makes a million. &lt;strong&gt;Andrew Clark&lt;/strong&gt; reports from New York on the auction of items including the fraudulent financier's family dog bowl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/douglas-hardy"&gt;Douglas Hardy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/iainchambers"&gt;Iain Chambers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/timmaby"&gt;Tim Maby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <title>Maradona receives two-month ban</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2009/nov/15/diego-maradona-ban-fifa-argentina</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.20.3/46500?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Argentina+coach+Diego+Maradona+banned+for+two-months+by+Fifa+for+foul+ou%3AArticle%3A1305487&amp;ch=Football&amp;c3=GU.co.uk&amp;c4=Diego+Maradona%2CFifa%2CArgentina+football+team%2CFootball%2CSport&amp;c6=Sid+Lowe&amp;c7=09-Nov-15&amp;c8=1305487&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=News&amp;c11=Football&amp;c13=&amp;c25=&amp;c30=content&amp;h2=GU%2FFootball%2FDiego+Maradona" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;â€¢ Argentina's World Cup preparations disrupted&lt;br /&gt;â€¢ Coach apologises for rant against journalists&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just when Argentina thought it was safe finally to prepare for the World Cup, their coach, Diego Maradona, was banned from football for two months last night. An often surreal, intensely controversial and deeply troubling year will draw to a close with no manager on the bench and a shadow hanging over the troubled national team who were defeated 2-1 here on Saturday by Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ban was handed down by Fifa in Zurich following a three-hour meeting  tonight and a 40-minute appearance from Maradona himself. The world governing body said that it had taken into consideration Maradona's apologies and "sincere regret" but the subsequent ban was still more severe than had been expected. Maradona will not be allowed to have any formal involvement in football until 15 January 2010 â€“ less than six months before the start of the World Cup. He was also fined 25,000 Swiss francs (Â£15,000).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The punishment follows Maradona's remarks after Argentina reached the World Cup with a 1-0 win over Uruguay in their final qualifying match on 14 October. He told journalists they "take it up the arse", grabbed his crotch and insisted the world's media should "suck it and keep on sucking". Fifa punished him according to Article 57, which relates to "offensive gestures or language". He has been warned a repeat will lead to even stronger sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Argentinian Football Association is expected to stand by the coach but no appeal is expected. Julio Grondona, the president of the AFA, is also vice-president of Fifa and was aware of the deliberations being made by football's governing body. In view of his coming in for severe criticism himself, it suits him for the media to focus more on the national team's coach than their president. Maradona is also a hugely lucrative draw, if not a particularly successful man, to have in charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maradona's assistant, Alejandro Mancuso, will take charge when Argentina face the Catalonia "national" team in a prospective friendly on 22 December in Barcelona and will also assume control if a proposed friendly against the Czech Republic is confirmed for 16 December. Maradona will be back in charge by the time the next formal international break comes round in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite boasting arguably the world's best player in Lionel Messi, Maradona's time in charge of the Argentina has been a largely disastrous one. He fell out with Juan RomÃ¡n Riquelme, despite once naming him as his footballing successor â€“ something he also did with Javier Saviola, Pablo Aimar and Messi â€“ and the playmaker has refused to return to the squad. Maradona has used 78 players since taking charge just over a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maradona's relationship with Carlos Bilardo, his coach at Mexico 86, also soured. Bilardo was employed as technical director to provide support for Maradona, only for the coach to demand he spend games in the stands "with a suit and tie on". In the relieved aftermath of the win over Uruguay, with emotions running high, the pair embraced and appeared to have settled their differences. But Maradona has continued to say he wants complete control over all footballing decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifa's officials had to decide if Maradona had breached Article 58 of Fifa's discipline code by "[offending] the dignity of a person or group of persons through contemptuous, discriminatory or denigratory words". That offence carries a mandatory five-match stadium ban which, if applied to competitive matches, would have sidelined him until after the World Cup quarter-finals stage. However, Maradona was judged by Article 57 relating to "offensive gestures or language".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/diego-maradona"&gt;Diego Maradona&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/fifa"&gt;Fifa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/argentina"&gt;Argentina&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/sidlowe"&gt;Sid Lowe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <title>Capello tells James to prove fitness</title>

Instead, Capello handed Ben Foster a fourth cap in Qatar and a chance to stake his own claim, though the Manchester United goalkeeper is only third choice at his club and admitted in the aftermath to being "disheartened" by his inability to make a real impression at Old Trafford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The England coach's instinct would be to select a fully fit James as first choice, with West Ham's Robert Green challenging Foster as No2, though Capello will need to see evidence of improvement in the Portsmouth goalkeeper's condition. "He has to be fit to be selected," said Capello. "We spoke with him and he needs more time to be really fit. Every time he plays he cannot train for two days after a game.We thought it would be best for him to stay home and train rather than come to Qatar. If he is fit, he will be with us. Probably."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the demands of tournament football â€“ with a number of games played within a relatively short period of time â€“ are already shaping Capello's decision-making. Asked whether he would consider James if his knee, which was flushed out in the summer but  swells up after matches, continues to hamper his ability to train, the Italian added: "No, no, we can't. It has to be sorted out before then. I don't know if he needs an operation but I do know he has some problems with his knee. If he is in the same situation in May, we will have to choose players who are all fit."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While James struggles with his fitness, Foster has been displaced at Old Trafford by the return of Holland's Edwin van der Sar from a wrist injury, with the Polish goalkeeper Tomasz Kuszczak having squeezed the Englishman from the bench in recent weeks. "It's very, very disheartening not even being on the bench," said Foster. "It was a bit out of the blue to be picked [against Brazil], to be honest. I'm third choice for Manchester United and yet I'm playing for my country. It's a weird one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, I'd like to be playing for my club. That's not happening, but the England boss is giving me a few chances I'm really grateful for that. It's just difficult at United with Edwin. He's one of the best keepers in the world. It's as simple as that. You can't go knocking on the manager's door and say he's not doing his job, because he is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foster had enjoyed a spell in the United team while Van der Sar was injured but, having endured the odd mistake in the spotlight, has not featured in the Premier League since the 2-2 draw with Sunderland early in October. He was subsequently selected for England's final qualifying fixture against Belarus, with Green suspended and James resting his knee but his only other appearance in the last six weeks had come in a Carling Cup tie at Barnsley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 26-year-old's frustration at a bit-part role with his club has merely been heightened by the realisation that he will need to be playing regularly if he is to gain selection for South Africa. Even so, Foster appears reluctant at present to confront the prospect of seeking out a loan movefrom United in search of the first-team football he requires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/england"&gt;England&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/ben-foster"&gt;Ben Foster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/fabio-capello"&gt;Fabio Capello&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/worldcup2010"&gt;World Cup 2010&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/davidjames"&gt;David James&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/dominicfifield"&gt;Dominic Fifield&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <title>Astro Boy ready to go global</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2009/nov/15/sam-leith-astro-boy</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.20.3/25825?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Astro+Boy+is+a+Japanese+superhero+whose+backside+fires+bullets.+How+cool%3AArticle%3A1305057&amp;ch=Books&amp;c3=Guardian&amp;c4=Comics+%28Books+genre%29%2CBooks%2CFilm%2CScience+fiction+and+fantasy+%28Film+genre%29%2CArt+and+design%2CCulture+section&amp;c6=Sam+Leith&amp;c7=09-Nov-16&amp;c8=1305057&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=Comment&amp;c11=Books&amp;c13=&amp;c25=&amp;c30=content&amp;h2=GU%2FBooks%2FComics" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are we ready for Astro Boy? He's a cute little robot with rocket boots, spiky black hair and â€“ winningly â€“ the ability to shoot bullets out of his backside. January sees the UK release of the animated Hollywood film Astro Boy, an all-star production, with voices coming from Donald Sutherland, Nicolas Cage, Charlize Theron and Bill Nighy. Their names are all over the movie's website. But where's the name of Astro Boy's creator, Osamu Tezuka? You'd need a magnifying glass to find any mention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her lavish new book The Art of Osamu Tezuka: God of Manga, Helen McCarthy acknowledges that her subject is not exactly well known in the west. The first chapter is titled: "Osamu Who?" The fact that the question needs to be asked is indicative of the enduring bafflement with which we regard Japanese pop culture. And the Japanese are not nearly as insular as us: were you to launch a book about Walt Disney over there, its opening chapter would not have to be titled: "Walt Who?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tezuka, who died 20 years ago this year, is a titanic figure in Japanese pop culture. Born into a wealthy family in 1928, he studied to be a doctor, but chose instead the infinitely more rackety and less respectable life of a manga cartoonist. It paid off. By his early 30s, he was Japan's highest earning artist; after his death, a Tezuka museum opened in his hometown of Takarazuka. Tezuka was the top creator of comics in a country where, according to one historian, more paper goes into the production of comics than goes into the creation of toilet roll. Comics remain a relatively niche interest in the west, but manga are thought to account for around a third of Japan's publishing industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Created, and then rejected, by a scientist who was seeking to fill the hole left by his dead son, Astro Boy is sometimes ill-used by humans. Nevertheless, he puts his powers, including the machine guns mounted on his buttocks, at the service of "humanity", even if the people around him often don't. And Astro Boy is just the beginning. Tezuka produced more than 150,000 pages of comic strip art: everything from mythic history and literary adaptations, to westerns and science fantasy. There's even a strip, called Black Jack, about the alarming adventures of a struck-off surgeon who does maverick medical work for exorbitant fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manga is not read in the same way as, say, the Beano. The comics are lighter on dialogue, much more visually stylised and far faster paced. You don't linger over the panels â€“ you whip through them. Tezuka's visual style is full of kinetic effects: if the foreground isn't whizzing past, the background will be. And his human figures have that doe-eyed look typical of Japanese cartooning, but with elements of EC&amp;nbsp;Segar, creator of Popeye, in there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the things that might surprise western eyes is the range of registers a single work can contain. Tezuka's eight-volume life of Buddha, for instance, is serious and thoughtful, yet is also interlarded with buffoonish comic business. His 1953 manga version of Crime and Punishment has pages of distinctly non-Dostoyevskian slapstick, and a cameo by a regular Tezuka character who pops up to shout his catchphrase: "Here t'meet ya!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tezuka's comics look outward to the world, too: his influences are decisively international. Individual frames, as McCarthy points out, reference Captain Nemo, Frankenstein â€“ and isn't that Mickey Mouse's hat from Fantasia? The backgrounds are pure Fritz Lang, full of hovercars reminiscent of chrome-crusted American cars from the 1950s. Astro Boy himself is a reimagining of Pinocchio (who is, perhaps, a semi-cutesy descendent of the Golem, the creature from Jewish myth made of inanimate matter).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bizarrely, Tezuka treated his comic creations more as actors than characters. They'd make guest appearances in different comics, playing new roles. Some were even aware they were in comics; Tezuka, already postmodern way back then, would frequently appear as a character, too. That disconcerting blend of seriousness and farce is, perhaps, one reason why manga's penetration into western culture is still somewhat limited. But thematic seriousness and low comedy coexist in Chaucer and Shakespeare, while emotional truth and physical caricature get along just fine in Dickens. So Tezuka might yet take off in Britain, especially if Astro Boy is a hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the themes of Astro Boy â€“ what it is to be a robot, what it is to be human â€“ are already there in the likes of I, Robot, AI and Blade Runner. But in none of those does the hero shoot bullets out of his bum. And that, if you ask me, is their loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/comics"&gt;Comics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/sciencefictionandfantasy"&gt;Science fiction and fantasy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/sam-leith"&gt;Sam Leith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.20.3/55484?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Diamonds+are+forever+%E2%80%A6+and+so+it+seems+in+Shirley+Bassey%27s+career%3AArticle%3A1305512&amp;ch=Music&amp;c3=Guardian&amp;c4=Shirley+Bassey%2CMusic%2CCulture+section%2CUK+news&amp;c6=Alexandra+Topping&amp;c7=09-Nov-16&amp;c8=1305512&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=News&amp;c11=Music&amp;c13=&amp;c25=&amp;c30=content&amp;h2=GU%2FMusic%2FShirley+Bassey" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Shirley Bassey sang Diamonds Are Forever in 1971, she can have had little idea that her own career would demonstrate the same longevity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today Bassey, 72, re-entered the album charts with her first album of original material in 20 years. The album, titled &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/nov/15/dame-shirley-bassey-the-performance" title="The Performance"&gt;The Performance&lt;/a&gt;, entered the charts at number 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her success is the latest example of a veteran artist who has found critical and commercial acclaim beyond retirement age. "It's been a vintage year for veteran artists," said Martin Talbot from the Official UK Charts Company. "The success of older acts has been growing over recent years but it has peaked in 2009."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of factors behind the twilight glory of older artists, including the changing retail landscape, said Talbot. "High street retailers like Zavvi and Woolworths have gone but supermarkets, where older music fans tend to buy their music, are playing a much bigger part in album sales. It is very easy for a Â£10 CD to get lost in a Â£150 shop," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Glastonbury in June, Neil Young, 64, drew breathless accolades from fans old and young, while 60-year-old Bruce Springsteen's staying power on the Pyramid stage put younger acts to shame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leonard Cohen has played to the biggest audiences of his life, aged 75, and when 67-year-old Barbra Streisand's 63rd album climbed to the top spot on the UK charts last month she became one of a handful of artists to have a number one album in five decades. And, at the age of 92, Vera Lynn became the oldest living artist to top the UK album chart with her greatest hits album in September, knocking Arctic Monkeys off top spot and outselling the positively embryonic Jamie T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Labels are realising that chasing the grey pound makes sense when a generation of younger music fans are used to getting their tunes for free, said Will Page, chief economist at PRs for Music. "With so much ambiguity around the return on an investment in a new record by an emerging band, a safer bet might be to exploit existing records from established acts," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is not just over-50s' spending power but their willingness to pay for music that makes the difference, according to Eric Garland, head of online media measurement company BigChampagne. "Younger music fans will invest time and passion into music, but are much more likely to reach into their wallet for a video console than music," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could have profound implications for the industry: "It is beyond worrying, it is a veritable crisis," he said. "Where are these career artists, the likes of REM, Coldplay, U2, going to come from in the future?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think we are seeing the swan song of the music industry just yet, but we may be seeing it in 20 years' time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/shirley-bassey"&gt;Shirley Bassey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alexandratopping"&gt;Alexandra Topping&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

In addition, there are fears that a market-based scheme, if successful, could encourage the government to withdraw public money from nature protection and rely on developers to protect Britain's most valuable wildlife sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do need a change in attitude to conservation. But there is a danger that it could be used to destroy something on a vague promise that it would be compensated for elsewhere. The devil is in the detail," said Tony Whitbread, chief executive of &lt;a href="http://www.sussexwt.org.uk/index.htm?id=default" title="Sussex Wildlife Trust"&gt;Sussex Wildlife Trust&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "banks", which could be run by local communities, voluntary groups or companies, would issue credits to create or manage wildlife reserves or other conservation initiatives. An open market would be set up by the government, and developers would have to buy credits at the going market rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The existing bureaucratic, regulatory approach has failed to halt biodiversity loss. We need radical new thinking to reverse the decline. Our natural ecosystems and the services they provide like carbon storage, water storage, habitat for wildlife are worth billions of pounds. We have to find a way to unlock this value", said Herbert, in an exclusive interview with the Guardian. "With a market approach we can look forward to new ways of supporting wildlife, habitats and landscape."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He denied that the money raised would be a new tax on developers or would lead to companies owning nature reserves. "This is not the privatisation of nature. This will not affect the value of land. It's about opening up a new revenue stream. The market system is a new, additional way to achieve protection of wildlife, not a substitute. I believe there will be a flourishing of schemes across the country," Herbert said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will rule out any proposals that would weaken the existing protection of endangered sites or species and ensure that any measures are in addition to existing safeguards regarding development on green spaces", said Herbert. "My goal is that the schemes would be managed by minimal bureaucracy. Protected land must remain off-limits to development. It is also essential that any new mechanism does not impose additional costs on businesses," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he declined to say whether the new banks would be run to make a profit or what it could cost to set up and maintain them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a new idea, and it needs more thinking through, but its definitely an idea worth thinking about," said Mark Avery, conservation director at the &lt;a href="http://www.rspb.org.uk/" title="RSPB"&gt;RSPB&lt;/a&gt;. "But we are perplexed how it would work in practice. The conundrum yet to be worked out is how does it produce lots of money without it being an unpopular tax on development? Also, how do you give local people a big say in how the money is spent whilst making sure that it delivers the greatest conservation benefit?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/cif-green/2009/nov/16/habitat-banking-conservative-conservation-credits"&gt;Government could generate a significant market mechanism&lt;/a&gt; for getting greater funding into the natural environment by implementing a policy for habitat banking in the UK. In the US wetland mitigation banking alone was worth $3bn in 2008 and there is no reason why we could not stimulate a similar system in the UK", said David Hill, a board member of &lt;a href="http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/" title="Natural England"&gt;Natural England&lt;/a&gt; and co-founder of the &lt;a href="http://www.environmentbank.com/" title="Environment Bank"&gt;Environment Bank&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea was first floated in a speech in February by the Conservative leader, David Cameron. "Conservation credits are about placing a value on biodiversity for the first time, because only if you place a value on something can you truly compensate for loss. This is potentially an incredibly exciting idea to enhance biodiversity, but the practicalities need careful consideration," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/conservation/"&gt;Conservation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/wildlife"&gt;Wildlife&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/endangered-habitats"&gt;Endangered habitats&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/conservatives"&gt;Conservatives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/greenpolitics"&gt;Green politics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/biodiversity"&gt;Biodiversity&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/johnvidal"&gt;John Vidal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

"I&amp;nbsp;know lots of very funny, clever friends on Twitter and it's like a warm blanket when you open it up every morning. But it all just suddenly seemed a bit too comfortable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So on 1 November, &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/ianmartin" title="Ian Martin's Twitter"&gt;Martin&lt;/a&gt; started a month-long experiment: he unfollowed all his friends on Twitter and replaced them with a wildly different list. "I decided to follow the most hateful people I could find," he says. He has filled his feed with rightwing extremists, religious fundamentalists, gun nuts, racists and homophobes. Now, each day when he logs on, he says he is deluged with what &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/malcolm_tucker" title="Malcolm Tucker's Twitter"&gt;Malcolm Tucker&lt;/a&gt; might call "arse plasma" from "the hideous mirrorworld of fuck" in the form of video links, sexist rants and antisemitic bile. In turn, he summarises what the far right is talking about in  &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/#search?q=%23wrongtwitter" title="#wrongtwitter posts"&gt;#wrongtwitter posts&lt;/a&gt; for his liberal followers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experiment is already taking its toll on his happiness. "Some of it's just heartbreaking, but the weirder edges of it get very boring â€“ it's the banality of evil. The ordinary conservative seems to be comparatively sane. It's a relief when you get people who are &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; calling for an armed revolution to get rid of Barack Obama because he is a Marxist&amp;nbsp;Muslim."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Front users have blocked him from reading their tweets, but others are enthusiastically retweeting him. He's losing some friends and gaining dubious new ones. "People are recoiling and unfollowing me but I'm picking up people too â€“ nutty followers in America who just assume I'm a Nazi."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He sounds as if he is regretting the idea but he's determined not to give up early. "It's a proper sacrifice. I'm trying not to have that casual contact with people that makes life worth living. The thing that wound me up was that everyone said it was a brave thing to do â€“ the same day a guy got blown up defusing a bomb in Afghanistan. All I'm doing is changing my Twitter feed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the moment, I'm amassing a huge archive of material, and I suppose at the end I will look for themes. The interesting thing is trying to track my mental disintegration through the month."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/twitter"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/the-thick-of-it"&gt;The Thick of It&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/far-right"&gt;The far right&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/timlusher"&gt;Tim Lusher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <title>British Columbia: call of the wild</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2009/nov/15/canada-fishing-british-columbia</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.20.3/17769?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=British+Columbia%3A+call+of+the+wild%3AArticle%3A1304113&amp;ch=Travel&amp;c3=Obs&amp;c4=Canada+%28Travel%29%2CFishing+%28Travel%29%2CWildlife+holidays%2CGreen+travel%2CHotels%2CTravel&amp;c6=Ruaridh+Nicoll&amp;c7=09-Nov-15&amp;c8=1304113&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=Feature&amp;c11=Travel&amp;c13=&amp;c25=&amp;c30=content&amp;h2=GU%2FTravel%2FCanada" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;Make your Jack London fantasies come true on the ultimate fishing trip in British Columbia, 100 miles from the nearest road&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I barely remember my grandfather â€“ only that he would clap his hands above his head if I behaved well and, more hazily yet, him turning towards a river, a split-cane fishing rod resting next to his perfectly bald head. I recall my mother far better, although she's been dead these 20 years. I see her standing in another river, deep in the Scottish Highlands where I was raised, throwing long, looping casts through the September sky. They would ride out over the water and land with barely a ripple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My grandfather was a talented fly-fisherman, but unlucky. My mother was superb, and lucky. I am a terrible fisherman, but lucky. Hearing that I was off to British Columbia, Canada, on the trip of a lifetime, my friend Olly said to another chum, "He probably won't catch, cos he casts like shite." But it doesn't work like that, as Olly well knows. There is more magic to fishing than skill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So it was that I found myself knee-deep in the Bell Irving, a river not far from the border with the Yukon. To get in, I had stepped over the heavy footprints of a grizzly bear and her cub, and pushed through a log jam where a beaver was building its nest. The river flowed at walking pace, and when I launched the fly, it swung back across the stream with the smoothness of a hand across the face of a clock. In the way of a heron standing sentry, I let nature reassert itself. I watched a snow shower blur the sky upriver, a rainbow cast outwards over the white-topped mountains and the autumn yellowing of the forest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as I let the rhythm of casting lull me, I remembered how, as a child, I found fishing boring â€“ the catching too infrequent and too dependent on the fish. Instead, I would sit on the riverbank with a rifle and try, unsuccessfully, to shoot the salmon when they jumped, while reading Jack London's &lt;em&gt;White Fang&lt;/em&gt; and imagining places just like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then the fly stopped and I felt the weight of a fish turning against the hook. One's focus shifts fast when fishing and so it was as I raised the tip of the rod. Used to salmon, I kept my hand close to the reel. That was a mistake. In a moment blood was spraying from my finger and the reel was, as they say, screaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A steelhead is a big fish, and this one was 7kg. Genetically, it is a rainbow trout but spiritually it is something else entirely. It has travelled out to sea and then swum back, climbing thousands of feet through waterfall and cataract and log jam in its desire to spawn, under the eyes of bear and eagle. Steelheads do not tire easily. Each time I brought her close she would run again, drawing the line swiftly across the pool, occasionally flashing into the air to spin, turn and tumble against the spike. The idea is to do as little harm to the fish as possible, so there was no barb on the hook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was first pondering this trip, my editor, believing one big article on fishing was probably enough for a while, told me to chase my dreams. So I thought about it, and thought about Jack London: I wanted wilderness, powerful fish, and to be as close to nature as is possible. I wanted to be where people normally do not tread. "Puny adventurers bent on colossal adventure, pitting themselves against the might of a world as remote and alien and pulseless as the abysses of space," as London put it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Americans call steelheads "chromers", because they're so shiny some will reflect the mountains back to you. This was true of the fish I finally scooped out of the net beside that log jam. The barbless hook slipped easily from her mouth and, having gazed at her in awe, I put her gently back in the stream, a thin smear of my blood on her flank. She waited for a moment in my hands and then, with powerful strokes, beat back into the stream where, soon, she would empty herself of her eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My brother Angus and I had taken a flight out of the horrors of Heathrow, with its shabby, money-grasping departure lounge, to Vancouver, all light, running water and polite officials, where the shops are dedicated to hockey, sailing and skiing. Crossing to the domestic terminal, with its departures to points north, we saw a different kind of traveller: rougher of skin, with heavy beards and wearing baseball caps advertising mining companies and tackle shops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A two-hour flight, the setting sun reflecting off glaciers and fiords, saw us settle into the damp browns and greens of Terrace, a rough logging town close to the Alaskan panhandle. In the small airport, the car hire woman suggested we watch out for "bear and moose on the road" and laughed, a touch manically. So we set out in the last of the light, slowing only to watch a big bull moose cross the gravel expanse of the Skeena river. The drive to the lodge was four hours and for the last two-and-a-half, we passed no signs of obvious habitation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fish we were hunting had been approaching from the opposite direction. Having left their home rivers two to four years before, they had grown sleek and heavy out at sea off Alaska. Frighteningly few return to their rivers to spawn. Only 2,000 a year are counted into the Bell Irving, which, given that the average hen lays 10,000 eggs, is haunting. Our adventure came with a precognition of tragedy, that despite the conservation measures now in place, man-made factors, from climate change to logging, may soon see their extinction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bell 2 Lodge was once a gas station but has grown into a collection of log cabins amid a dense forest of aspen, alder and mountain hemlock. Hunters, tourists and miners travelling the Alaskan highway stop for the superb food and, in winter, a substantial heliskiing operation. The fishing was an afterthought. The owners saw a market not only for taking people out on the Bell Irving, but also for flying them by helicopter to the Naas river, the upper part of which is 100 miles from the nearest road. The fish there are unlikely to have ever seen an artificial fly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we ate breakfast, our guides appeared. Steve McPhail and Michael Brackenhofer are dissimilar men. Canadian Steve brings a Zen attitude of "do no harm" to his job. Against attack by bear or bull moose, he carries a small can of pepper spray and what is, in essence, a party popper. Bavarian Michael, on the other hand, carries a short, ugly rifle of the sort the outlaw Jesse James might have used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve took us down to the Bell Irving, reversing his metal-hulled skiff into the clear waters and then, with the outboard fired up, navigating through torrents and placid pools, past the remnants of log jams and under great cottonwoods, yellow in the late September sunlight, while Chloe, his princess of a Labrador, flinched against the freezing spray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we powered forward, I realised I was happy: as I get older, I find fishing brings me peace. And I was happy until 9.23am on that first day, because that is when my brother caught his first steelhead. I try to wish the best for my fellow man, but when it comes to fishing, I'm with Gore Vidal. Every time a friend of mine is successful, a little part of me dies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of days later we headed  downhill from the lodge to the waiting helicopter, a Bell Ranger with room, at a push, for five. Angus, a fellow Brit called Nico and I stood nearby, kitted up in waders and the thickest woollens we could find.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm not riding bitch," said Steve, jumping into the front seat. We packed into the back and lifted off, heading downriver and crossing the forest before climbing through a valley and up into the snow-covered peaks. Between the swirling clouds, we could make out mountain goats on their vertiginous ledges. As we crossed the high passes the tips of the rotors were only feet from the cliffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon, the weather licked at us and the pilot was forced to circle down a thousand feet into a thin layer of clear air above an exuberant stream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Do you think this is the Muskaboo?" he asked Steve. We explored on, across a landscape that may never have felt a human footprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Imagine five guys smoking in here," said Nico, playing with the ashtray. When the view opened up, we saw a large meandering river, the Nass, and followed it until the water pooled on great gravel beds. Leaves and sticks scattered as we drew down to land. After dropping us, the Bell flew off to collect a raft left downstream by a previous party. "Juicy water," said Steve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wandered up to the neck of the pool, the opposite bank a thick wall of hemlock and cottonwood, and immediately found action. Then Angus connected with an astonishing fish that ran from him for 60 metres or so, before charging back, leaving my brother to grab handfuls of line in an effort to keep tension on the barbless hook. He looked astonished by the battle when at last Steve swept the fish into his net. "This knocks salmon into a cocked hat," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We fished the Nass for two days, flying back to the lodge each evening. We drifted through pools and rapids on the inflatable, expertly guided by Steve, who also found time to barbecue steaks. Sometimes we would see a moose gazing at us from the bank. Otherwise we were alone. In places, the water flowed so smoothly over the uneven rock it left us awestruck. We could be certain of the presence of the fish in this, their perfect resting place. The fly, a pink piece of fluff I called a Barbara Cartland, would stop, and then everything would explode. If Steve was nearby he would whoop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the evenings, back at the lodge, having changed and warmed ourselves by the log fires in our rooms, we would have dinner together. Nico and I argued about global warming, listened to politely by the guides and Sid, the pilot. When we finally shut up, they chimed in, discussing the changes they had seen â€“ from later winters to the way magnetic north has shifted. They spoke with a dignity and depth that made me feel like an urban blowhard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Sid would later tell me he had started out mining in eastern Canada, but given it up when two of his friends died below ground. Now his office is the vast expanse of the north beyond the screen of his helicopter. He exudes an extraordinary calm, and an odd politeness straight out of the Coen Brothers' &lt;em&gt;Fargo&lt;/em&gt;. "Are you ready? Rightyo then.")&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On our final day Michael stepped in as guide, taking us back on the Bell Irving. A true denizen of the mountains, he pointed out terrifying slopes high above us that he had skied. He is cutting a five-mile track through the forest so that he can reach the high alp and hunt mountain goats on the cliff edges. His knowledge is both profound and personal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The aspen is the world's largest organism," he said. "Many, many trees share a root. It is why whole woods can turn yellow at once."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those dreams I had had as a child in the Highlands, reading Jack London, were embodied in the way Michael lives. Yet this lifestyle would have a catastrophic effect on most relationships, and certainly mine. The only alternative is to visit, and that requires wealth. Nico is rich enough to come here because he sold a large company in the late 90s. Yet, as Steve pointed out, it is only the money of well-off visitors that protects the life of these extraordinary fish. The loggers would come for the trees otherwise, and the spawning grounds would be destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On that last day, such privileged access meant we fished close to some extraordinary creatures. A black bear slowly crossed the river above us, looking back only once. At lunch â€“ a picnic of soup, beer and sandwiches â€“ we watched a curious ermine skip towards us through a log pile. It probably fancied a go at my jugular. I caught a final fish, bringing my score for the week to nine steelheads, along with a Coho salmon and a 3kg bull trout. Angus was close behind (ha!). For the salmon fishermen, used to days without catching, this was a dream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing however, compared with a moment up on the Nass a couple of days before. I had been struggling to keep my footing on a steep bank. The casting was difficult, left-handed into the stream, and I was imagining building a platform in the trees, setting up home, when a viscerally unsettling cry went up. It was the sound that Jack London described: "Palpitant and tense... It might have been a lost soul wailing, had it not been invested with a certain sad fierceness and hungry eagerness."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I gazed over at the opposite bank and out along the trunk of a long-dead cottonwood walked a wolf. It reached the furthest point and turned to stare over at me. In the face of this, the truest incarnation of the wilderness, I forgot my daydream. Another howl rose from beyond, and the wolf turned and, without haste, wandered back and out of sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Essentials&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ruaridh Nicoll's journey to Bell 2 lodge was organised by James Moreland of Elemental Adventure (020 7836 3547; &lt;a href="http://www.eaheliskiing.com" title="eaheliskiing.com"&gt;eaheliskiing.com&lt;/a&gt;), which organises heliskiing trips worldwide. Bell 2's dedicated fishing site is &lt;a href="http://www.steelhead-fishing.net" title="steelhead-fishing.net"&gt;steelhead-fishing.net&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A nine-night trip to Bell 2 costs from Â£5,000. It includes two nights in Vancouver, transfer from Terrace Airport, seven days of guided steelhead fishing including two days' helicopter fishing and five days' jet boat and raft access on the Bell Irving, Meziadin, Naas or Bear rivers, full-board accommodation in a single room, licences and use of fly-fishing equipment including spey rod or single handed rod and all flies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information on the area, see Tourism British Columbia's site, &lt;a href="http://www.BritishColumbia.travel" title="BritishColumbia.travel"&gt;BritishColumbia.travel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ruaridh flew from Edinburgh to  Heathrow with bmi (0844 848 4888; &lt;a href="http://www.flybmi.com" title="flybmi.com"&gt;flybmi.com&lt;/a&gt;, returns from Â£72) and from there to Terrace with Air Canada (0871 220 1111; &lt;a href="http://www.aircanada.com" title="aircanada.com/uk"&gt;aircanada.com/uk&lt;/a&gt;; returns from Â£769).

The cosy kitchen has an Aga, but catering â€“ and staff â€“ can be arranged, to help make the most of the 60s-chic dining room and the "leisure lounge" â€“ a soundproofed disco in the basement with decks, and an adjoining dressing-up room.

There are two converted barns, housing eight and six, plus a studio annexe for three more.

THE SHOOTING LODGE, WRACKLEFORD, DORSET&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One mile from the nearest road, high on the Dorset downlands, this rustic lodge â€“ complete with tower â€“ is as remote and rural as it gets. There is no mains electricity and no telephone; instead, most of the utilities run on gas, and there are logs for open fires, wall lamps and lots of candles. There are five bedrooms, including a single room in the tower which is accessed via a steep spiral staircase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;â€¢ Sleeps nine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;â€¢ One week from 23 December, Â£2,500.

      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine/katine-chronicles-blog/2009/nov/12/community-unhappiness</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.20.3/67471?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=How+can+you+please+everyone+in+Katine%3F%3AArticle%3A1304286&amp;ch=Katine&amp;c3=GU.co.uk&amp;c4=two+years+on+%28katine%29%2CKatine+amref%2CGovernance+%28Katine%29%2CKatine+news%2CKatine%2CUganda+%28News%29%2CAid+and+development+%28Society%29%2CSociety&amp;c6=Joseph+Malinga&amp;c7=09-Nov-12&amp;c8=1304286&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=Blogpost&amp;c11=Katine&amp;c13=&amp;c25=Katine+Chronicles+blog&amp;c30=content&amp;h2=GU%2FKatine%2Fblog%2FKatine+Chronicles+blog" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;Over the past two years Amref has clearly made significant improvements in Katine. So why are some of the community unhappy? Joseph Malinga explains&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is now two years since the launch of the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine/2008/sep/23/background.news"&gt;Katine project&lt;/a&gt;, with its aim of improving education, health, livelihoods, water and sanitation and community empowerment in the rural sub-county.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the African Medical and Research Foundation (Amref), which is implementing the project, has made significant improvements over the last two years, some sections of the community do not seem entirely happy with the project. There are probably many reasons for this. One is perhaps related to the region's history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amref's work is designed to help the community recover from more than two decades of conflict and cattle rustling that has rocked the Teso region in which Katine is found.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mistrust and security concerns following &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/katineblog/2009/apr/02/museveni-divided-uganda"&gt;Yoweri Museveni's seizure of power&lt;/a&gt; in 1986 (Museveni decided to disband local militias that had protected the region against cattle rustlers, which had blighted the area for years), forced many in Teso to pick up arms to protect themselves, their properties and their livelihoods. The rebel group became the Uganda People's Army (UPA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The region soon became &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/katineblog/2009/mar/16/teso-insurgency-violence"&gt;a battlefield&lt;/a&gt; between the UPA, government forces and the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine/katineblog/2009/feb/24/teso-insurgency-museveni-uganda-karamojong"&gt;Karamojong&lt;/a&gt;. Around this time Alice Lakwena formed the Holy Spirit Movement, a rebel group that would become the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine/lra"&gt;Lord's Resistance Army&lt;/a&gt; (LRA), which attacked Katine in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teso had embraced the idea of rebellion not so much to gain political power but to avoid economic loss. Desperation and frustration had set in, explaining why the young people who joined the rebellion sang songs with the words: "Mimi na yenda mistuni, juu ya mali ya baba. Kazi yetu ni shida shida. Mimi nakula kibawo juu - ya-mali ya baba kazi yetu ni shida shida..." The Kiswahili song could be translated into both local languages, Ateso and Kumam. It meant: "I went to join the bush war because of my father's wealth. Our job is troublesome. My father's wealth has made me starve - our work is trouble."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Impact of conflict&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of all the fighting has been telling on the community. Many people witnessed horrific scenes â€“ loved ones murdered, families torn apart â€“ which have not only left the region socially and economically stunted, but has also entrenched political hostility towards central government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conflict destroyed the region's economic base. Before the fighting, Teso was a prosperous area, rooted in agriculture. Children were educated to university level and people had sustainable incomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But under Museveni, national industries, such as cotton and coffee, were privatised, which affected the local cotton production. Dairies, local electricity systems, railways and schools were damaged in the fighting, which resulted in job losses and a collapsed infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, the raids by the LRA forced many families into internally displaced people's camps and saw people killed and kidnapped and homes destroyed. People in Katine had to pick up the pieces and start again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural calamities have exacerbated the situation. In 2007, the region was hit by torrential rains and more recently a severe drought, both of which have destroyed crops and led to serious food shortages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the period of conflict, floods and drought there  is little evidence that local leaders or the government did much to rehabilitate the community in Katine. Improvements have been largely down to NGOs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amref's intervention, of which the community has high expectations, has resulted in &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine/interactive/2009/nov/02/two-years-on-achievements"&gt;significant improvements&lt;/a&gt; in the sub-county.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new school has been built, another is under construction and other schools have had classrooms and offices built or repaired. Desks and textbooks have been distributed to schools and teachers have received training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boreholes have been drilled, shallow wells constructed and pit latrine coverage in the community has improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Village health teams and health workers have been trained, anti-malaria bed nets have been distributed and a new lab has been opened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farmers groups have been trained and supported and a new strain of cassava grown. Building work has begun on a &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine/2009/sep/22/produce-store"&gt;produce store&lt;/a&gt; to allow farmers to store crops and sell in bulk, and share market information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Village savings and loans associations have been established.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Community dissatisfaction&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So why are some sections of the community unhappy with the project? The biting poverty resulting from conflict and the reliance on assistance from NGOs has created a dependency culture and an individualistic attitude among the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amref's work focuses on developing the community rather than benefiting individuals. As a result, a number of villagers have brushed-off the project's achievements. While they appreciate the clean water and the improved school structures, they still say Amref is not doing enough. When you ask what they mean by "not enough"  it seems to come down to the fact they haven't benefited personally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, some members of the community who visit the media resource centre in Katine hope to get something more from their visit than computer training or the chance to go online. Someone asked me whether visiting the media centre would lead to a job. I told him no, and since then he has not been back often.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People seem to compare Amref with &lt;a href="http://www.childfund.org"&gt;ChildFund International&lt;/a&gt; (formerly the Christian Children's Fund), an NGO working in Katine that does support individuals. The organisation has a focus on child sponsorship so has paid school fees, and it distributes animals to individuals. The &lt;a href="http://www.tpoug.org/"&gt;Transcultural Psychosocial Organisation&lt;/a&gt; (TPO) also helps individuals, although it does try to strengthen community structures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some of the community's eyes, Amref was meant to build them houses, educate their children and provide them with all basic necessities. These ambitions have not been realised and the question they ask is when will this be achieved?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This raises the question of how aware the community is of the aims of the project and the work being carried out. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems to me there is clearly a need for Amref to better explain the reasons for the project and its methods of  operation widely to the community. And Amref needs to ensure a constant information flow between itself and the community if its work is going to be owned and sustained after it leaves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reversing the effects of more than 20 years of conflict is not going to be easy, but this may be a necessary step if Amref wants to avoid criticism that it's not doing enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine/two-years-on"&gt;Two years on&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine/amref"&gt;Katine amref&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine/governance"&gt;Governance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/katine/news"&gt;News&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/uganda"&gt;Uganda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/international-aid-and-development"&gt;International aid and development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/joseph-malinga"&gt;Joseph Malinga&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <title>How to break bad news</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/nov/15/news-of-death-bbc-huw-edwards</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.20.3/65721?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=How+to+break+bad+news+%7C+Jon+Canter%3AArticle%3A1305363&amp;ch=Comment+is+free&amp;c3=Guardian&amp;c4=Media%2CBBC%2CTelevision+%28Culture%29%2CTelevision+and+radio%2CUK+news%2CAfghanistan+%28News%29&amp;c6=Jon+Canter&amp;c7=09-Nov-15&amp;c8=1305363&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=Comment&amp;c11=Comment+is+free&amp;c13=&amp;c25=Comment+is+free&amp;c30=content&amp;h2=GU%2FComment+is+free%2Fblog%2FComment+is+free" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;If you have to tell people that a friend has died, it's best to get in touch with your inner Huw Edwards&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, I heard about Bruno. Have you heard about Bruno? Have you heard about Sarah? Have you heard about Jonny/Geoffrey/John? I've reached the age and the stage where all have-you-heards are followed by bad news. In fact, they're followed by the worst: Bruno and Sarah and Jonny and Geoffrey and John are dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that moment, bizarre and illogical as it is, I feel upset that the dead person hasn't called me themselves. It seems mean that they've left it to someone else. "Have you heard about me?" Bruno would say, to which I'd reply, shocked: "No! When? What happened?" "&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/conditions/pulmonarythromboembolism1.shtml" title="Pulmonary embolus"&gt;Pulmonary embolus&lt;/a&gt;," he'd&amp;nbsp;reply, "this morning. As I was having a cup of coffee." At which point â€“ given there's not much use in asking how he is â€“ I'd at least have the chance to say: "OK, right, then. Goodbye."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Invariably, I ask the bereaved person if there's anything I can do; and invariably they ask me to make a few calls on their behalf, sparing them the awful repetition that's the bane of the bearer of worst tidings. This is when my BBC training kicks in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My BBC training, I should explain, is that of a viewer. Decades of watching newsreaders, from &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/1999/dec/20/guardianobituaries" title="Robert Dougall"&gt;Robert Dougall&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/ten/2655339.stm" title="Huw Edwards"&gt;Huw Edwards&lt;/a&gt;, have taught me that these people are in their jobs precisely because they're so skilled at telling us who's just died. This isn't the place to debate whether good news is no news, though the Good News Bible does seem a misnomer, given that Jesus died for our sins many, many bulletins ago. The fact is, death â€“ currently, of British soldiers in &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/afghanistan" title="Afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt; â€“ is the top news story of the day, whatever the day is. Like all newsreaders, Huw, with his magnificently melancholic grave-digger's mouth, is on the Grim Reaper's payroll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give it to them straight. That's what I've learned from the Beeb. Come out with it. Deliver your headline. If you're calling someone to tell them your mutual friend Bruno's dead, don't delay. Niceties beget niceties. You ask how they are, they ask how you are; suddenly, they're telling you how well their daughter did in her GCSEs, which you're obliged to interrupt with the news of Bruno's death, as if their daughter's exam results aren't important, which of course they're not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instinctively, before you break your bad news, you want to get them in the mood. (Who can blame you? This is the function performed by the self-important graphics and tension-inducing beeps that precede the Bad News At 10.) Don't do it. Don't conjure the mood by saying, in a sonorous voice, that you're calling them to tell them something awful. This is meant to give them time to sit down and prepare themselves. It's your way of being kind to be cruel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is, in fact, doubly cruel. It gives them time to imagine what your something awful's going to be. Inevitably, they imagine you're about to tell them their husband/wife/partner/child has died in an accident. So, when you tell them about Bruno, it comes as a kind of perverse relief. Phew. It's only Bruno that's died. Their friend, not their loved one. Surely, Bruno deserves better than to have his demise relegated to not-so-bad news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State the headline, then amplify it: time and cause of death, state of nearest and dearest, funeral arrangements and so on. You'll then sense that your bulletin is coming to an end. This is when â€“ to change channels â€“ you'll find you're suddenly in touch with your inner Sir Trevor McDonald. You'll feel obliged to provide your audience with an "and finally" moment. Death is not the end. It can't be. The end is something cheery. This, after all, is British news we're talking about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So you deliver your "and finally": it was quick, he didn't suffer much, at least he lived long enough to go to his daughter's wedding, he had a long&amp;nbsp;innings. (As long as you think in terms of the limited-overs game, not a&amp;nbsp;Test match.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These homilies aren't news, though. They're speculation. How do you know&amp;nbsp;he didn't suffer much? Did he tell&amp;nbsp;you? No. Let bad news be bad news. There'll be time, later, when the news has sunk in, for a comforting little joke about The Weather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/bbc"&gt;BBC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/television"&gt;Television&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/joncanter"&gt;Jon Canter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.20.3/10735?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Sexblogger%27s+tale%3A+How+my+life+changed+forever+%7C+Zoe+Margolis%3AArticle%3A1305479&amp;ch=Comment+is+free&amp;c3=Guardian&amp;c4=Blogging+%28Technology%29%2CInternet%2CTechnology%2CBooks%2CCulture+section%2CUK+news&amp;c6=Zoe+Margolis&amp;c7=09-Nov-15&amp;c8=1305479&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=Comment&amp;c11=Comment+is+free&amp;c13=&amp;c25=Comment+is+free&amp;c30=content&amp;h2=GU%2FComment+is+free%2Fblog%2FComment+is+free" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not easy being outed. Three years ago I was doorstepped by the Sunday Times; as I opened my front door, a secret photographer took photos of me. The paper then threatened to use these in their exposÃ© of me, in the hope I would succumb to vanity and agree to an interview and photoshoot. &lt;a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article601445.ece" title="The spread ran"&gt;The spread ran&lt;/a&gt; â€“ without my contributing to it â€“ two days later and the three years of anonymity I had as the author of the sexblog &lt;a href="http://girlwithaonetrackmind.co.uk" title="Girl with a One Track Mind"&gt;Girl with a One Track Mind&lt;/a&gt; was lost in an instant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the next week, tabloid newspaper journalists and photographers stalked my house and doorstepped my neighbours; harassed my parents; turned up at my workplace; made enquiries at my old college; and offered money to arbitrary acquaintances of mine to dish dirt on me. They even contacted people I knew on Friends Reunited, asking them to spill the beans. I went into hiding, unable to cope with the press onslaught and felt like I was on the verge of a breakdown. Finally, I&amp;nbsp;ended up doing an interview with &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/aug/11/gender.booksonhealth" title="the Guardian"&gt;the Guardian&lt;/a&gt; because I thought that might take the heat off the "story". It did: the paparazzi departed and the tabloids stopped calling. But my life, as I knew it, was forever changed; I am still piecing it back together even now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the news of fellow sexblogger Belle de Jour's true identity being revealed, again in the Sunday Times, as &lt;a href="http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article6917260.ece" title="Brooke Magnanti"&gt;Brooke Magnanti&lt;/a&gt;, I'm sure her life will change, too. Unlike me, it seems it was &lt;a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/11/14/nsfw-belle-de-jour-brooke-magnanti-anonymous-blogging/" title="her choice to out herself"&gt;her choice to out herself&lt;/a&gt; ; she gave the paper an in-depth interview. &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/belledejour_uk/status/5733792269" title="responding to someone on Twitter"&gt;On Twitter&lt;/a&gt; she says: "We went to the Times willingly, after the Mail had their reporters warned off my work premises by the police," so evidently her hand was still pushed into revealing her identity and giving the paper their "exclusive".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Magnanti seems at ease with her unmasking: "It's time. I don't mind what happens about coming out; I don't want this massive secret over me any more." I can relate to that: having to keep up a facade with everyone in your life is exhausting. I wonder, though, if she's ready for the inevitable media blitz and prepared for every part of her life to be held up to public scrutiny. Things will die down in the press once the story is no longer fresh news, but with one quick click on Google, Magnanti's legacy as the formerly anonymous prostitute Belle de Jour will continue to live on; sadly that may impact her life in ways she could not possibly predict&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Girl with a One Track Mind: Exposed by Zoe Margolis, will be published by  Pan Macmillan, March 2010.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/blogging"&gt;Blogging&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/zoemargolis"&gt;Zoe Margolis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/nov/15/healthy-snacks-sugar-salt-nutrition-lunchbox</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.20.3/19939?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=%27Healthy%27+snacks+loaded+with+sugar+or+salt%2C+says+consumer+group%3AArticle%3A1305472&amp;ch=Life+and+style&amp;c3=Guardian&amp;c4=Food+and+drink+%28Life+and+style%29%2CParents+and+parenting%2CLife+and+style%2CChildren+%28Society%29%2CSociety%2CConsumer+affairs+%28Money%29%2CMoney%2CUK+news&amp;c6=Rebecca+Smithers&amp;c7=09-Nov-15&amp;c8=1305472&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=News&amp;c11=Life+and+style&amp;c13=&amp;c25=&amp;c30=content&amp;h2=GU%2FLife+and+style%2FFood+%26+drink" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;â€¢ Lunchbox product labels 'confusing' for parents &lt;br /&gt;â€¢ Calls for more robust rules on nutritional value claims&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supposedly healthy snacks that are popular in children's lunchboxes, such as cereal bars and fruit drinks, are laden with sugar, a consumer group has warned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which? analysed the nutritional content of a range of items targeted by leading manufacturers at children's lunchboxes and found that a combination of the most sugary food and drinks could yield the equivalent of 12 teaspoonfuls of sugar in one meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report said that of the numerous such products on supermarket shelves, "many declare that they don't contain additives, but don't mention they're also full of salt or sugar â€“ giving the impression they're healthier than they are".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those singled out is Robinsons Fruit Shoot orange juice drink, with each 200ml bottle containing 23g of sugar â€“ the equivalent of almost five teaspoonfuls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report's analysis also shows that Kellogg's Frosties Cereal and Milk bars are made up of seven different sugars, which means the 25g bar is almost a third (8g) sugar. The company's website says: "Fortified with vitamins, iron and calcium, now you can give your kids a great tasting snack that you can be sure won't come back from school in the lunchbox!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Munch Bunch Double Up fromage frais contains more than two teaspoons (12.4g) of sugar, but only 2.25g of fruit puree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those high in salt is a pack of Dairylea Lunchables Ham 'n' Cheese crackers, which contains 1.8g of salt â€“ more than half the government's recommended daily allowance of 3g for a four- to six-year-old child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which? points out that Dairylea promotes the fact that this product contains half of a child's recommended daily calcium intake. However, it still remains high in fat and saturated fat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help families choose healthier food, Which? is calling for more robust rules on when products can make health and nutrition claims. It says this would stop manufacturers making items that contain high amounts of sugar, fat and salt appear healthier than they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martyn Hocking, editor of Which? magazine, said: "Parents should be able to pick out healthy products for their kids' lunchboxes, but what you see isn't always what you get. Some products give the impression of being healthy, but are full of salt and sugar."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added: "The best way to beat the lunchbox baddies is by checking the nutrition and ingredient information. We'd also like to see the rules on health and nutrition claims made tougher, so there's less confusion on the supermarket shelves."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britvic, which manufacturers Robinsons Fruit Shoots, said all its products provided clear nutritional information on packs. A spokesman said: "85% of all Fruit Shoot purchased is low-sugar, with less than 2.4g of sugar per 200ml. Fruit Shoot offers a range of choices to suit a variety of needs, including Fruit Shoot H2O â€“ a low-calorie flavoured water â€“ and Fruit Shoot 100% Pure Juice that counts as one of the recommended five-a-day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the lunchbox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fruit Shoot orange juice drink&lt;/strong&gt; Each 200ml bottle has 23g of sugar, almost five teaspoons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kellogg's Frosties Cereal and Milk bars&lt;/strong&gt; Made up with seven different sugars, the 25g bar is almost a third sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fruit Factory fruit strings&lt;/strong&gt; A 24g portion of fruit strings contains 13.7g of sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Munch Bunch Double Up fromage frais&lt;/strong&gt; Contains more than two teaspoons (12.4g) of sugar, but only 2.25g of fruit puree.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dairylea Lunchables Ham 'n' Cheese crackers&lt;/strong&gt; Contains 1.8g of salt, more than half the daily allowance for a four- to six-year-old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source: Which?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/food-and-drink"&gt;Food &amp; drink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/parents-and-parenting"&gt;Parents and parenting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/children"&gt;Children&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs"&gt;Consumer affairs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/rebeccasmithers"&gt;Rebecca Smithers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <title>What should I wear to a protest?</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2009/nov/16/ask-hadley-protest-march</link>
      <description>&lt;div class="track"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.20.3/66517?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=What+should+I+wear+to+a+protest+march%3F%3AArticle%3A1304902&amp;ch=Life+and+style&amp;c3=Guardian&amp;c4=Fashion%2CLife+and+style&amp;c6=Hadley+Freeman&amp;c7=09-Nov-16&amp;c8=1304902&amp;c9=Article&amp;c10=Feature&amp;c11=Life+and+style&amp;c13=Ask+Hadley+%28series%29&amp;c25=&amp;c30=content&amp;h2=GU%2FLife+and+style%2FFashion" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p class="standfirst"&gt;The art of looking chic while taking to the streets has long been neglected&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There's a need for someone to discuss the correct way to dress for a protest: how to appear serious while avoiding looking slightly deranged? And then, of course, there's the standard-issue sign versus hand-crafted, and does it convey the wrong priorities if it's  colour-co-ordinated with one's outfit?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Annabelle, by email&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This letter is, yes, longer than usual but it is so particularly awesome that to cut it felt like taking a pair of shears to the Turin shroud.  For, truly, there has never been  a clearer indication of the existence of a divine Almighty than someone considering whether they should co-ordinate their protest sign with their protest outfit. Annabelle, as my  personal guru Stephen Colbert would say, a tip o'my hat to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are quite right: the subject of protest chic is one that has been long neglected and, really, I hang my head in shame. All those anti-war protests that had so little effect on government policy? I blame myself. The people were just not properly attired. But let us take a tip from Tony Blair and not waste time on regrets but rather focus on the future. A future in which neither of us will be president of the EU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First: How Not To Look Slightly  Deranged. There are obvious points here, and ones that should apply to all areas of life, not just protests, so no facial jewellery, no dreadlocks,  no glow in the eye of self-righteous indignation fed with the oxygen of half-formed arguments, which is  only just about acceptable in stoned undergraduates and is certainly not in anyone over the age of 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clothes that look as if they were bought in Camden market (wacky-wacky, thumbs-aloft, baggy striped trousers; anything with a pompom) are obviously &lt;em&gt;verboten&lt;/em&gt;. Unless you are Elizabeth Hurley, you probably will not be tempted to wear heels to a protest (and what would Liz be protesting about, do we think,  people? Perhaps a criminal nationwide shortage of white denim?). Plain and practical are the obvious styles to aim for, but  nothing in army green because that risks you  being mistaken for a rent- a-protester, army green  generally being their chosen colour. Similarly, no T-shirts  or other paraphernalia that  indicate you have frequented other protests: you think it proves your passion, others think you're just a protest slut in it for the exercise and the day off work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for signs, I am a &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; fan of homemade ones, simply for the show of  creativity, and if anyone in the protest notices you have co-ordinated yourself with your sign, you are not in a protest, you are in Selfridges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One wardrobe factor to  consider most carefully is how it will help Fox News? Last week Jon Stewart revealed that, in order to make an anti-healthcare protest look more popular than the sparsely  attended event actually was, Fox News simply used footage from a more  popular rally from two months back. Clever, no? So think of this, people. Next time your boss demands the  work he asked for yesterday, but which you haven't finished because you've been too busy playing on Facebook/ Grindr/Netaporter (delete as demographically relevant), just show him some work you did two months ago  because, like, it's basically the same thing, innit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, with the needs of Fox News  always at the forefront of one's mind, the obvious thing to do here is to wear the same outfit to every protest, thereby making Fox presenter Sean Hannity's job just that little bit easier. Of course, the power of fashion can only go so far and one thing it cannot do is control the seasons and the sad end to this story is that Fox was caught out in its small manipulation of the truth because the trees in Washington DC in November should be autumnal in colour and yet in Fox's footage they were a suspicious shade of green. But as Hannity no doubt said when his  little mistake was exposed, one can only work with the tools one has. And then lie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a 40-year-old man, can I wear socks with Crocs (I tried to avoid that rhyme) or are they deemed "sandals" and therefore unsockable?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jason Davis, by email&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is not that they are  sandals, Jason. It is that they are Crocs, and Crocs are unacceptable, be-socked or otherwise. And remember this maxim: rhymes â€“ good for poems, bad for outfits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Post your questions to Hadley Freeman, Ask Hadley, The Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

      <title>State-owned rail line raises fares 5%</title>

It has now secured improved financial terms, whereby it does not have to pay the estimated Â£180m due to the DfT this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elaine Holt, chairman of East Coast, said: "These fares were set by National Express some time ago. This is a commercial operation and there are many good value-for-money fares available."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From January some off-peak fares booked in advance on East Coast, which are not covered by price caps, will rise by between 3% and 5% despite a deflationary economic environment that saw the retail price index at -1.4% in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In line with the rest of the industry, regulated fares including savers and season tickets will fall by 0.4% leaving rail operators to compensate for the revenue shortfall by increasing the cost of unregulated fares such as advance purchase tickets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holt said East Coast will make "substantially lower" payments to the DfT despite the fare increases. "We have agreed a new payment schedule with the department and the payments are substantially lower than those made by National Express, which is why I am confident about the financial future of this franchise," she said. Holt added that off-peak advance booking fares represented less than two out of ten tickets put on sale by East Coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The head of the rail user watchdog, Passenger Focus, said the fare increases were "particularly tough" because they no longer appeared necessary. Anthony Smith, Passenger Focus chief executive, said: "These fare increases were being sought by a company that was in a very different financial position. We would very much hope that, under government control, we will see restraint whenever fare levels are being contemplated in the future.".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Association of Train Operating Companies is due to announce next year's fare levels imminently. Rail industry executives are striving to keep the average increase for unregulated fares as low as possible amid fears of a public backlash. Passenger Focus has also warned against hiking car parking fees as a means of compensating for the fall in cost of regulated fares, which account for two out of five journeys on the network and are the financial bedrock of commuter franchises. Regulated fares set in January are capped at the rate of inflation plus 1%, pegged at the RPI level for July the previous year. With July's RPI coming in at -1.4% this year, season tickets and savers will be forced down by 0.4% in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With RPI due to return to positive levels next year the long-term trend, however, is one of regular price increases. Under the government's five-year rail strategy, fare payers will account for about three-quarters of the industry's funding by 2014, contributing about Â£9bn a year. Earlier this year, Passenger Focus published research showing that Britain had the most expensive commuter rail network in Europe, prompting its chief executive to warn that public appetite for fare increases had "reached its limit".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Holt added that the government had no intention of retaining the East Coast franchise permanently, despite creating a new company, Directly Operated Railways, that is capable of taking on more contracts if necessary. The government is considering whether to strip National Express of its c2c and National Express East Anglia franchises under cross-default guidelines, but faces a legal challenge from their owner if it tries to increase its franchise empire. Asked if East Coast will be retendered in 2011, as promised by the DfT, Holt said: "It intends to do a re-franchising process and that is what is going to happen." East Coast ended its first full day under government ownership on Saturday. A spokesman for the operator said services were "running smoothly" despite bad weather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Express is trying to lure customers from its former East Coast franchise on to its coach network. In an email sent to customers, the group offered 50% off coach bookings and the chance to win Â£1,000 in a prize draw. Asking, "Why not give it a try?" the email advertises the 1,000 destinations served by National Express coaches and, perhaps mindful of East Coast fare hikes, refers to its 99p special offers. "With fares as low as 99p and a guaranteed seat, you can save money as you travel in comfort."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/nationalexpressgroup"&gt;National Express&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/rail-transport"&gt;Rail transport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/railtravel"&gt;Rail travel&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/transport"&gt;Transport policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/danmilmo"&gt;Dan Milmo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;

      <title>Madoff auction raises $900,000</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2009/nov/15/bernard-madoff-auction-sheraton</link>

But even the notorious Wall Street fraudster might have balked at the lofty prices paid for his personal belongings by souvenir hunters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 500 people filled the ballroom of Manhattan's Sheraton hotel yesterday for an auction of 200 items of property seized by the US Marshals Service from Madoff and his wife, Ruth, following the exposure of the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/dec/13/useconomy-usa-fraud" title="disgraced fund managers $65bn Ponzi scheme"&gt;disgraced fund manager's $65bn Ponzi scheme&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those willing to get out their cheque books, it was an opportunity to buy a slice of the couple's lavish lifestyle. Lots under the hammer included jewellery to artwork, silverware and china. And there were more prosaic offerings such as the family dog bowl, surf boards and personalised Post-It notes from Madoff's desk. The sale raised more than $1m (Â£600,000).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As bidders gathered in front of a stage shrouded in red velvet, it became clear that this was no ordinary auction. The first Madoff-related lot, a seaside-themed charm bracelet, had a guide price of $700 to $1,000 â€“ but went for $3,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anything connected to the jailed financier fetched many times more than the estimated value set by the auctioneers, Gaston &amp; Sheehan. A pair of diamond earrings worn by Ruth Madoff fetched the biggest price of $70,000, more than quadrupling its estimated value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most feverish bid battles raged for items marked with the schemer's name. A New York Mets baseball jacket with "Madoff" embroidered on the back was sold for $14,500, smashing its guide price of $500. And a chipped school ring from the fraudster's alma mater, Hofstra College, engraved with the initials BLM, was bought for $6,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Proceeds of the sale will go to &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2009/jun/29/madoff-victims-organise" title="Madoffs wide galaxy of victims"&gt;Madoff's galaxy of victims&lt;/a&gt;, including hedge funds, charities and private individuals who lost their savings in the fraudster's three-decade scam. But the money is paltry in comparison with the scale of investors' losses. At least two suicides have been blamed on the scam masterminded by Madoff, who is &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2009/oct/21/bernard-madoff-prison-legal-papers" title="serving a 150-year sentence at a federal prison in North Carolina"&gt;serving a 150-year sentence at a federal prison in North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One bidder told the Guardian that the auction was an opportunity to combine an investment with a good cause.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Madoff is infamous. He'll probably go down in history as the largest schemer ever," said Mark Greenspan, a cosmetic surgery marketing executive, who paid $6,500 for one of Madoff's Rolex watches. "It's a piece of history and it's good that the proceeds will go to the victims."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the property on the block was of distinctly dubious quality. The Madoffs appear to have had a penchant for framed posters advertising European railway networks, and for seascapes. One auction observer, Lark Mason, described the offerings as equivalent to "a fancy suburban garage sale".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But those in the hall, plus 1,000 online bidders joining the auction through cyberspace, seemed to see value in the most mundane bric-a-brac. A lot comprising a fishing tackle box and a boogie board marked "Madoff" in black pen fetched $1,000. And three polo shirts bearing the name of Madoff's yacht, Bull, were snapped up for $1,300.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A life belt from Madoff's vessel was sold for $7,500 to Dave Goodboy, a hedge fund manager, who told the New York Times: "It's like having something off the Titanic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a buyer paid $2,000 for a wooden sign, obscurely marked BLM 216. The sign, it seems, once stood outside the Madoff family's beachside retreat on Long Island â€“ at 216 Old Montauk Highway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="related" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/bernard-madoff"&gt;Bernard Madoff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/financial-crisis"&gt;Financial crisis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/credit-crunch"&gt;Credit crunch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="author"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/andrewclark"&gt;Andrew Clark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;div class="terms"&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2009 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both" /&gt;
